       "'MARCH # All Stories New and Complete Publisher Editor IF is published bi-monthly by Quinn Publishing Company, Inc., Kingston, New York. Volume #, No. #. Copyright # by Quinn Publishing Company, Inc. Application for Entry\\' as Second Class matter at Post Office, Buffalo, New York, pending. Subscription # for # issues in U.S. and Possessions: Canada # for # issues; elsewhere #. Aiiow four weeks for change of address. All stories appearing in this magazine are fiction. Any similarity to actual persons is coincidental. #c a fcopy. Printed ia U.S. A. A chat with the editor  i #  science fiction magazine called IF. The title was selected after much thought because of its brevity and on the theory it is indicative of the field and will be easy to remember. The tentative title that just morning and couldn\\'t remember it until we\\'d had a cup of coffee, it was summarily discarded. A great deal of thought and effort lias gone into the formation of this magazine. We have had the aid of several very talented and generous people, for which we are most grateful. Much is due them for their warmhearted assistance. And now that the bulk of the formative work is done, we will try to maintain IF as one of the finest books on the market.  t a great public demand for our magazine. In short, why will you buy IF? We cannot, in honesty, say we will publish at all times the best science fiction in the field. That would not be true. But we will have access to the best stories, and we will get our fair share of works from the best writers. We definitely will not talk \"adult\" or \"juvenile\" relative to our content as we feel such terms are misleading. We would rather think at all times in the terms of \"story\". Some of the greatest escapist literature ever written, Treasure Island for instance, could be put into either category or both. And if Edgar Rice Burroughs is juvenile, then so are we, because the late master has given us some memorable thrills. Frankly, we don\\'t think you\\'ll buy IF because you feel we print better yams than any other mag. You will buy it, we hope, because you like its personality. Every magazine, we feel, does have a definite personality of its own. This personality is usually a reflection of the editors, their way of thinking, their appreciation of tKe market, their interpretation of what you will like best in stories and artwork. We have tried to make IF different from any other science fiction magazine on the stands while still building it along the lines of what every science fiction mag must be. Aside from the letter columns and the editorial, which are departments of field-wide use, we have not copied any feature of any other magazine. We will not, for instance, review fanzines, because we feel that is being most ably done by other mags. Nor will we, as a general practice, review books because that appears to us to be overdone. a personality of our own and hope thereby to establish an affinity with a large number of readers who will remember IF when they buy a science fiction mag as one they like and wish to continue reading. At all times we will hew to the story-line and will exhort with our writers to do the same. As an example, when Howard Browne phoned to talk over the plot for his lead novel in this issue, he described what ivas without doubt a staggering premise, a really startling concept. \"But,\" he mourned, S T suppose I\\'ll have to bend it around to give them the good old conventional ending.\" We told Howard, \"Not for IF, chum. Remember the old creed we live by. A writer may cheat on his wife, but he is ever true to the story-line. He may haul his infant son around by one leg. but he carries a good story-idea like a holy relic. If there is only one logical ending for Twelve Times ZerG, that\\'s the ending we want.\" Therefore, we do not feel the majority of readers necessarily want a happy ending regardless of all else. Not when it is incompatable with the aura of realism created by the writer. A check-list of fiction masterpieces certainly bears this out. The furor created by a little piece called Sorry , Wrong Number would certainly not have been forthcoming had the bedridden lady been rescued in the last paragraph. Romeo and Juliet would have beep nothing more than the smooth effort of the world\\'s greatest writer if Romeo had gotten there in time. Yet, in modern fiction, he gets there in time with such amazing regularity one feels he has memorized at least  a dozen time-tables. The result has been unnumbered carloads of mediocre fiction. Also -- though we don\\'t wish to underscore the point too heavily -- what could more surely have smothered the greatness of Wuthering Heights than a happy ending?  that IF will be a magazine given over to tragedy. W e will only insist that our writers create scenes and climaxes that fix the story rather than cater to that old \"debil\" formula. And in so doing we have an entirely selfish motive. This: As the years go by, we want to look back with personal pride upon an everlengthening list of great stories. So the book you now hold in your hands is a new one titled IF. We hope you will like it -- not for just a day -- not for just a month. But for years to come. pwf  Police grilled him mercilessly # while eyes from a hundred worlds looked on  It was a love-triangle murder that made today\\'s headlines but the answer lay hundreds of thousands of light years away! one of the basement rooms. He moved slowly and with a kind of painful dignity, as a man moves on his way to the firing squad. A rumpled shock of black hair pointed up the extreme pallor of a gaunt face, empty at the moment of all expression. Harsh light from an overhead fixture winked back from tiny beads of perspiration dotting the waxen skin of his forehead. The three men with him watched him out of faces as expressionless as his own. They were ordinary men who wore ordinary clothing in an ordinary way. yet in the way they moved and in the w r ay they stood you knew they were I hard men who were in a hard and largely unpleasant business. One of them motioned casually toward a straight-backed chair almost exactly in the center of the room. \"Sit there, Cordell  I he said.  A quiet voice, not especially deep, yet its seemed to bounce off the painted concrete walls. Wordless, the young man obeyed. Sitting, he seemed as stiff and uncompromising as before. The man who had spoken made a vague gesture and the overhead light  went out, replaced simultaneously by strong rays from a spotlight aimed full at the eyes of the seated figure. Involuntarily the young man\\'s head turned aside to avoid came out of the wall of darkness and jerked it back again. # \\'Just to remind you , # the quiet voice continued conversationally, \"I\\'m Detective Lieutenant Kirk, Homicide Bureau . # A pair of hands thrust \\'a second chair toward the circle of light. Kirk swung it around and dropped onto the seat, resting his arms along the back, facing the man across a distance of hardly more than inches. In the pitiless glare of the spotlight CordelPs cheekbones  stood out sharply, and under his deepset eyes were dark smudges of exhaustion. His rigid posture, his blank expression, his silence -- these were laid out, our first idea was to stage the scoop of the century: Get the lead novel from Howbe given an infant publication than Browne\\'s name on the cover. We asked Howard and he asked bis boss, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Davis said, \"Sure.\" oldest science-fiction publication in the world. It has the largest circulation in its field and up to January # th (the day IF went on the science fiction magazine your money could buy. It has the best writers in the field. Its departments are exfanzine reviews and Sam Merwin reviewing the books. So if you have a spare quarter, get a copy of And now, about Howard Browne. He is a huge man, made up almost entirely of vast enthusiasms. We have known Howard intimately for about six years and we continue to regard him with awe. There is no middle ground with this man. When he likes something, it\\'s terrific If Howard hung a picture in his office we doubt if it would be a casual chore. The hammer he used would be a terrific hammer. The tack he drove would outshade other tacks by five country miles. And the picture? Gad, what a masterpiece! Seriously, one has only fo view Browne\\'s enthusiasm for living to know it for what it is -- a priceless gift. He has written unnumbered short stories and, under the name of John Evans, is the father of near future. We have watched him write several of his stories and he hurled himself into each with a zeal and a zest that sfunned us into a partial paralysis. So we give you Howard Browne, a hard fellow to classify ; an astounding mixture of Balzac, a ten-ton dynamo, and Peter Pan. But this above all -- a great guy.  seemed not so much indications of defiance as they did the result of some terrible and deepseated shock, \"Let\\'s go over it again, Cordell,\" Kirk said. The young man swallowed audibly against the silence. One of his hands twitched, came up almost to his face as though to shield hiseyes, then dropped limply back. \"That light -- \" he mumbled. \" -- stays on , # Kirk said briskly. # The quicker you tell us the answers, the quicker we all relax. Okay?\" Cordell shook his head numbly, not so much in negation as an effort to clear the fog from his tortured mind. T told you,\" he cried hoarsely. \"What rpofe do you want? Yesterday I told you the whole thing.\" His voice began to border on hysteria. \"What good\\'s my trying to tell you if you won\\'t listen? How\\'s a guy supposed -- \" \"Then try telling it straight!\" Kirk snapped. \"You think you\\'re fooling around with half-wits? Sure ; you told us. A crazy pack of goof-ball dreams about a blonde babe clubbing two grown people to death, then disappearing in a ball of blue light! You figure on copping a plea on insanity?\" \"It\\'s the truth!\" Cordell shouted. \"As God hears me, it\\'s true!\" Suddenly he buried his face in his hands and long tearing sobs shook his slender frame. O ne of the other men reached out as though to drag the young man\\'s face back into the withering rays of the spotlight, but Kirk motioned him away. Without haste the Lieutenant fished a cigar from the breast pocket of his coat and began almost leisurely to strip away its cellophane wrapper. A kitchen match burst into flame under the flick of a thumb nail and a cloud of blue tobacco smoke writhed into the cone of hot light. \"Cordell,\" Kirk said mildly. Slowly the young man\\'s shoulders stopped their shaking, and after a long moment his wan, tearstained face came back into the light. \"I -- I\\'m sorry,\" he mumbled. Kirk waved away the layer of smoke hanging between them. He said wearily, \"Let\\'s try it once more. Step by step. Maybe this time... He let the sentence trail off, but the inference was clear. An expression of hopeless resignation settled over Cordell\\'s features. \"Where do you want me to start?\" \"Take it from five o\\'clock the afternoon it happened.\" The tortured man wet his lips. \"Five o\\'clock was when my shift went off at the plant. The plant, in case you\\'ve forgotten, is the Ames Chemical Company, and I\\'m a foreman in the Dry Packaging department.\" \"Save your sarcasm,\" Kirk said equably. \"Yeah. I changed clothes and punched out around five-fifteen. Juanita had called me about four and said to pick her up at Professor Gilmore\\'s laboratory,\" # At what time?\" \"No special time. Just when I could get out there. We were going to have dinner and take in a movie. iN\\'o particular picture; she said we\\'d pick one out of the paper at dinner \" \"Go on . # \"Well, it must\\'ve been about quarter to six when I got out to the University. I parked in front of the laboratory wing and went in at the main entrance. I walked down the corridor to the Professors office. His typist was knocking out some letters and there were a couple of students hanging around waiting for him to show up. How about a smoke, Lieutenant?\" Kirk nodded to one of the men behind him and a package of cigarettes was extended to the man under the light. A match was proffered and the young man ignited the white tube, his hands shaking badly. The Lieutenant crossed his legs the other way. \"Let\\'s hear the rest of it, friend.\" \"What for?\" Bitterness tinged Cordell\\'s voice. \"YoU don\\'t believe a word I\\'m saying.\" \"Up to now I do \" \"Well. I said something or other to Alma -- she\\'s the Profs secretary -- and went on through the door to the hall that leads to the private lab. When I got -- #  K irk held up a hand. \"Wait a minute. Your busting right in on the Professor like that doesn\\'t sound right. Why not wait in the office for your wife?\" \"What for?\" Cordell squinted at him in surprise. \"He and I get... , got along fine. When Juanita first went to work for him he said to drop in at the lab any time, not to wait in the outer office like a freshman or something.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"Well... The young man hesitated. \"We\\'re back to the part you don\\'t believe, Officer. I can\\'t hardly believe it myself ; but so help me, it\\'s gospel. I saw it!\" \"I\\'m waiting.\" Cordell said doggedly: \"The lab door was open a crack. I heard a woman\\'s voice in there, and . it wasn\\'t my wife\\'s. It was a voice like -- like cracked ice. You know: cold and kind of... well... brittle and -- and deadly. That\\'s the only way I can describe it. \"Anyway, I sort of hesitated there, outside the door. I didn\\'t want to go bulling in on something that wasn\\'t none of my business... but on the other hand I figured my wife was in there, else Alma would\\'ve said so.\" \"You hear anything besides this collection of ice cubes?\" \\' The young man\\'s jaw hardened. \"I\\'m giving it the way it happened. You want the rest, or you want to trade wise cracks?\" One of the men behind Kirk lunged forward. \"Why, you cheap punk -- \" Kirk stopped him with an arm. \"I\\'ll handle this, Miller.\" To Cordell: \"I asked you a question. Answer it.\" \"I heard Professor Gilmore. Only a couple words, then two quick flashes of light lit up the frosted glass door panel. That\\'s when I heard these two thumps like when somebody falls down. I shoved open the door fast... and right then I saw her!\" Kirk nodded for no apparent reason and was careful about knocking a quarter inch of ash off his cigar. \"Tell me about her.\" The young man\\'s hands were shaking again. He sucked at his cigarette and let the smoke come out with his words : \"She was clear over on the other side of the lab... standing a good two feet off the floor in the middle of a big blue ball of some kind of -- of soft fire. Blue fire that sort of pulsed -- you know. Anyway, there she was: this hell of a good-looking blonde ; looking right smack at me, and there was this funny kind of gun in her hand. She aimed it and I ducked just as this dim flash of light came out of it. Something hit me on the side of the head and I... well, I guess I blanked out.\" \"Then what?\" \"Well, like I said yesterday, I suppose I just naturally came out of it. I\\'m all spread out on the floor with the damndest headache you ever saw. Over by the window\\' is the Prof and -- \" he wet his lips -- \"and Juanita. They\\'re dead. Lieutenant; just kind of all piled up over there... dead, their heads busted in and the -- the -- the -- \" H e sat there, his mouth working but no sound coming out, his eyes staring straight into the blazing light, the cigarette smouldering, forgotten, between the first two fingers of his left hand. Almost gently Kirk said: \"Let\\'s go back to where you were standing outside the door. You heard this woman talking. What did she say?\" Cordell looked sightlessly dowm at his hands. \"Nothing that made sense. Sounded, near as I can remember, like: \\'Twelve times zero\\' -- then some words, or more numbers maybe -- I\\'m not sure -- then # she said, \\'Chained to a two hundred thousand years\\' -- and the Professor said something about his colleges having no idea and he\\'d warn them -- and the blonde said, \\'Three in the past five months\\' -- and then something about taking in washing -- \" \\' The detective named Miller gave a derisive grunt. \"Of all the goddam stories! Kirk, you gonna listen to any -- \" Kirk silenced him with a gesture. \"Go on, Cordell\" The young man slowly lifted the cigarette to his mouth, dragged heavily on it, then let it fall to the floor. \"That\\'s all. That\\'s when the lights started flashing in there and I tried to be a hero.\" \"Sure you\\'ve left nothing out?\" \"You\\'ve got it all. The truth, like you wanted.\" Kirk said patiently, \"Give it up, Cordell. You\\'re as sane as the next guy. Give that story to a jury and they\\'ll figure you\\'re trying to make saps out of them -- and when a jury gets sore at a defendant, he gets the limit. And in case you didn\\'t know: in this State, the limit for murder is the hot seat!\" The prisoner stared at him woodenly. \"You know I didrPt kill my wife -- or Professor Gilmore. I had no reason to -- no motive. There\\'s got to be a motive. The police officer rubbed his chin reflectively. \"Uh-hunh. Motive. How long you married, Cordell?\" \"Six years.\" \"Children?\" \"No.\" \"Ames Chemical pay you a good salary ?\" \"Enough.\" \"Enough for two to live on?\" \"Sure\" \"How long did your wife work for Professor Gilmore?\" \"Four years next month.\" \"What was her job?\" \"His assistant.\" \"Pretty big job for a woman, wasn\\'t it?\" \"Juanita held two degrees in nuclear physics.\" \"You mean this atom bomb stuff?\" \"That was part of it.\" \"Gilmore\\'s a big name in that field, I understand.\" Kirk said. \"Maybe the biggest.\" \"Kind of young\\' to rate that high, wouldn\\'t you say? He couldn\\'t have been much past forty.\" Cordell shrugged. \"He was thirty-eight -- and a genius. Genius has nothing to do with age, I hear.\" \"Not married, I understand.\" \"That\\'s right...\" A slow frown was forming on Cordell\\'s face. \"How old was your wife?\" Kirk asked. The frown deepened but the young man answered promptly enough. \"Juanita was my age. Twenty-nine.\" Martin Kirk eyed his cigar casually. \"Why,\" he said, \"did you want her to walk out on her job; to give up her career?\" Cordell stiffened. \"Who says I did?\" he snapped. \"Are you denying it?\" \"You\\'re damn well right I\\'m denying it! What is this?\" K irk was slowly shaking his head almost pityingly. \"On at least two occasions friends of you and your wife have heard you say you wished she\\'d stay home where she belonged and cut out this \\'playing around with a mess of test tubes? Those are your own words, Cordell.\" \"Every guy,\" the young man retorted, \"who\\'s got a working wife says something like that now and then. It\\'s only natural.\" Kirk\\'s jaw hardened. \"But every guy\\'s wife doesn\\'t get murdered.\" The other looked at him unbelievingly. \"Good God,\" he burst out, \"are you saying I killed Juanita because I wanted her to stop working? Of all the -- \" \"There\\'s, more!\" snapped the Homicide man. \"When you passed Professor Gilmore\\'s secretary in his outer office yesterday, what did you say to her?\" \" \\'Say to her?\\' \" \\'the, prisoner echoed in a dazed way. \"I don\\'t know that #... Some kidding remark, I guess. How do you expect me to remember a thing like that?\" \"I\\'ll tell you what you said,\" Kirk said coldly. \"It goes like this: \\'Hi, Alma. You think the Prof\\'s through making love to my wife?\\' \" Cordell\\'s head snapped back and h!s jaw dropped in utter amazement. \"What! Of all -- ! You nuts ? I never said anything like that in my life! Who says I said that?\" Without haste Kirk slid a hand into the inner pocket of his coat and brought out two folded sheets of paper which he opened and spread out on his knee. \"Listen to this, friend,\" he said softly. \" \\'My name is Miss Alma Dakin. I reside at # Monroe Street, and arn employed as secretary to Professor Gregory Gilmore. At approximately # : # on the afternoon of October #, Paul Cordell, husband of Mrs. Juanita Cordell, laboratory assistant to Professor Gilmore, passed my desk on his\\'way into the laboratory. I made no effort to stop him, since my employer had previously instructed me to allow Mr. Cordell to go directly to the laboratory at any time without being announced.\\' \" Kirk looked up at the man in the chair opposite him. \"Okay so far?\" t Paul Cordell nodded numbly. \" \\'At the time stated above,\\' \" Kirk continued, reading from the paper, \" \\'Mr. Cordell stopped briefly in front of my desk. He seemed very angry about something. He said, \"Hi, Alma. You think the Prof\\'s through making love to my wife?\" Before I could say anything, he turned away and walked into the corridor leading to the laboratory. I continued my work until about five minutes later when Mr. Cordell came running back into the office and told me to call the police, that Professor Gilmore and Mrs. Cordell had been murdered. \" \\'Since there is an automatic closer on the corridor door, I did not see Mr. Cordell enter the laboratory\\' itself. I do \"know, however, that Professor Gilmore and Mrs. Cordell w r ere alone in the laboratory less than ten minutes before Mr. Cordell arrived, as I had just left them alone there after taking some dictation from my employer. Since I went directly to my desk, and since there is no entrance to the laboratory other than through my office, I can state with certainty that Mr. Cordell was the only person to enter the laboratory between #:# that afternoon and # : # when Mr. Cordell came out of the laboratory and told me of the murders. \" \\'I hereby depose that this is a true and honest statement, to the best of my knowledge, that it was given freely on my part, and that I have read it before affixing my signature to its pages. Signed: Alma K. Dakin.\\' \" T here was an almost ominous crackle to the document as Lieutenant Kirk folded it and returned it to his pocket. Paul Cordell appeared utterly stunned by what he had heard and his once stiffly squared shoulders were slumped like those of an old man. \"I don\\'t have to tell you,\" Kirk said, \"that the only window in that laboratory is both permanently sealed and heavily barred. No one but you could have murdered those two people. You say you saw them killed by some kind of a gun. Yet a qualified physician states both deaths were caused by a terrific blow from a blunt instrument We found a lot of tilings around the lab you could have used to do the job -- -but nothing at all of anything like a projectile fired from a gum\" The prisoner obviously wasn\\'t listening, \"B -- but she -- she lied!\" he stammered wildly. \"All I said to Alma Dakin was a couple of words -- three or four at the most -- about not working too hard. Why should she put me on a spot like that? I just -- don\\'t -- get -- it! Why should she go out of her way to make trouble... Dawning suspicion replaced his bewilderment. \"I get it! You cops put her up to this; that\\'s it! You need a fall guy and I\\'m \"Listen to me, Cordell,\" Kirk cut in impatiently. \"You knew, or thought you knew, your wife was having an affair with Professor Gilmore. You tried to break it up, to get her to leave her job. She wasn\\'t having any of that; and the more she refused, the sorer you got. Yesterday you walked in on them unannounced, found them in each other\\'s arms, and knocked them  both off in a jealous rage. When you cooled down enough to see what you\\'d done, you invented this wild yarn about a blonde in a ball of fire, hoping to get off on an insanity plea.\" \"I want a lawyer!\" Cordell shouted. Kirk ignored the demand. \"You\\'re going back to your cell for a couple hours, buster. Think this over. When you\\'re ready to tell it right, I want it in the form of a witnessed statement, on paper. If you do that, if you co-operate with the authorities, you can probably get off with a fairly light sentence, maybe even an outright acquittal, on the old \\'unwritten law\\' plea. I don\\'t make any promises. Gilmore was a prominent man and a valuable one; that might influence a jury against you. But it\\'s the only chance you\\'ve got -- and I\\'m telling you, by God, to take, it!\" Cordell was standing now, his face working. \"Sure; I get it! All you\\'re after is a confession. What do you care if it\\'s a flock of lies? My wife wouldn\\'t even look at another man, and not you or anybody else is going to make me say different. That blonde killed them, I tell you -- and I\\'ll tell a jury the same thing! They\\'ll believe me; they\\'re not a bunch of lousy framing cops! You\\'ll find out who\\'s -- \" Lieutenant Martin Kirk wearily ground out his cigar against the chair rung. \"All right, boys. Take him back upstairs.\" Chapter II I T was a gray chill day late in November, and. by #:# that afternoon the ceiling lights were on. Chenowich, the young plainclothes man recently transferred to Homicide from Robbery Detail, stopped at Martin Kirk\\'s cubbyhole and slid an evening paper across the battered brown linoleum top of the Lieutenant\\'s desk. \"This oughta interest you # he said, jabbing a chewed thumbnail at an item under a two-column m  the left # s er of Wife and Atom Wizard .  , was today Criminal Court Justice P.

A jury last week found Cordell uilty of the brutal slayings despite his testimony that it was a mysterious blonde woman, floating in a \"ball of blue fire,\" who had blasted the victims with a \"ray gun\" on that October afternoon. Ignoring the \"girl from Mars\" angle, alienists for the prosecution pronounced the handsome defendant sane, and his attorneys were powerless to offset the damage. The final blow to Cordell\\'s hopes for acquittal, however, was administered by the State\\'s key witness, Alma Dakin, Gilmore\\'s former secretary. For more than three hours she underwent one of the most cal courtroom ,  .  Kirk shoved the\\' paper aside. \"What could he expect when he wouldn\\'t even listen to his own lawyers?

Want me to get rid of her?\" Kirk eyed the mound of paper work on his desk and sighed. \"Probably a taxpayer. All right; send her back here.\" A moment later the patrolman loomed up outside the cubbyhole door, the woman in tow. Lieutenant Kirk remained seated, nodded briskly toward the empty chair alongside his desk. \"Please sit down, madam. You wanted to see me?\" \"You are Mr. Kirk?\" A warm voice, almost on the husky side, \"Lieutenant Kirk.\" \"Of course. I am sorry.\" . ful about Kirk stared was worth for a voluptuous by exactly the right margin. Her face was more lovely than beautiful, chiefly because of large eyes so blue they were almost purple. Her skin was flawless, her blonde hair worn in a medium bob fluffed out, and hersmooth fitting tobacco brown suit must have been bought by appointment. She looked to he in her mid-twenties and was probably thirty. Her expression was solemn and her smile fleeting,, as was becoming to anyone calling on a Homicide Bureau. She placed on a corner of Kirk\\'s desk an alligator bag that matched her shoes and tucked ple yellow gloves the color of her blouse under the bag\\'s strap. Her slim fingers, ringless, moved competently and without haste. a I am Naia North, Lieutenant Kirk.\" \"What\\'s on your mind, Miss North?\" She regarded him gravely, seeing gray-blue eyes that never quite lost their chill, a thin nose bent slightly to the left from an encounter with a drunken longshoreman years before, the lean lines of a solid jaw, the dark hair that was beginning to thin out above the temples after thirty-five years. Even those who love him, she thought, must fear this man a little. Martin Kirk felt his cheeks flush under the frank appraisal of those purple eyes. \"You asked for me by name, Miss North. Why?\" \"Aren\\'t you the officer who arrested the young man who today was sentenced to die?\" Only years of practise at letting nothing openly surprise him kept Kirk\\'s jaw from dropping...You mean Cordell?\" \"Yes.\" \"I\\'m the one. What about it? What\\'ve you got to do with Paul Cordell?\"... Naia North said quietly, \"A great deal, I\\'m afraid. You see, I\\'m the woman who doesn\\'t exist; the one the newspapers call \\'the girl from Mars.\\'\" It was what he had expected fronuher first question about the case. Any murder hitting the headlines brought at least one psycho out of the woodwork, driven by some deep-seated sense of guilt into making a phony confession. Those who were harmless were eased aside; the violent got detained for observation. But Naia North showed none of the signs of the twisted mind. She was coherent, attractive and obviously there was money somewhere in her vicinity. While the last two items could have been true of a raving maniac, Kirk was human enough to be swayed by them. \"I\\'m afraid,\" he said, \"you\\'ve come to the wrong man about this, Miss North.\" His smile was frank and winning enough to startle her. \"The case is out of my hands; has been since the District Attorney\\'s office took over. Why don\\'t you take it up with them?\" H er short laugh was openly cynical. \"I tried to, the day the trial ended.

Not that I\\'ll enjoy being a public spectacle, but at least they\\'ll give me some action.\" \"What do you want done?\" She put both elbows on the desk and bent toward him. He caught the faint odor of bath salts from under the rounded s of her blouse. \"That man ieutenant.

You know that nobody could have gone into that laboratory without her seeing them. You know that Alma Dakin testified that there were only two people in there: Gilmore and Juanita Cordell. So, Miss North, how did you get in there after Alma Dakin and before Paul Cordell arrived?\" \"But I didn\\'t.\" The Lieutenant\\'s air sagged under \\'D# a # What do you mean \"I didn\\'t enter \"# after Greg\\'s secretary I t into his eyes. there all along . a traightened and her gaze haven\\'t tunelessly. \"You  \"I was girl repeated exact. I p# everybody would be out to lunch between twelve and one, so I went to the laboratory with the intention of facing Greg there on his return. When I heard him and Mrs. Cordell coming along the corridor, I sort of lost my nerve and hid in a coat closet.\" Martin Kirk had completely dropped bis air of good-humored patience by this time. \"You telling me you were hiding in there for almost five hours without them knowing it?\" Naia North shrugged her shoulders. \"They had no reason to look in the closet. I\\'ll admit I hadn\\'t intended to -- to spy on Greg. But I kept waiting for him to say or do something that would prove or disprove he was in love with Juanita Cordell, and not until his secretary left and he was alone with her did I discover what was between them. I must have come out of that dark hole like a tiger. Lieutenant. They jumped apart and v two people never looked guiltier. He said something particularly nasty to me and I grabbed up a short length of shiny metal from the workbench and hit him across the side of the head before lie knew what was happening. He fell down and the Cordell woman opened her mouth to scream and -- and I hit her too.\" She paused as though to permit Kirk to comment. \"Go on.\" he said hoarsely. \"There\\'s not much left \" the girl said. \"I was standing there still holding that piece of metal when the door crashed open and the dead woman\\'s husband ran in. He started to lunge across the. room at me and I threw the thing I was holding at hiim It struck him and he fell down. My only thought was to hide, for I realized I couldn\\'t go out through the outer office, and the only window was barred. So I hid in that closet again. \"It was onlya few minutes before Paul Cordell regained consciousness. He staggered out of the room and down the hall and I could hear a lot of excited talk and Greg\\'s secretary calling the police. Then I didn\\'t hear anything at all for a moment, so I came out of the closet and looked down the hall. The office door was closed, but it seemed so quiet in there that I tiptoed quickly to the inner door, opened it a crack and peered through. The office was deserted; evidently Cordell and Miss Dakin had gone out to direct the police when they showed up. \"When I saw there was no one in the main hall of the building itself, I simply walked out and left by another exit. No one I passed even noticed me.\" F or a long time after Naia North had finished speaking, Martin Kirk sat as though carved from stone, staring blindly into space. She knew he was thinking furiously, weighing the plausibility of what he had heard, trying to arrive at some method of corroborating it in a way that would stand up in a court of law. \"Miss North.\" She came out of a reverie with a start, to find the Lieutenant\\'s eyes  boring Into hers. \"This shiny hunk of metal you used : where is it now?\", \"Fra sure I wouldn\\'t know. Probably some place in the laboratory, unless somebody took it away. I do seem to remember picking it up and tossing it back with several others like it on the bench.\" \"Then it\\'s still there,\" he said slowly. \"Judge Reed ordered the room sealed up until after the trial. And then there\\'s the closet... , . Were you wearing gloves that afternoon, Miss North?\" She said, \"No. You\\'re thinking of fingerprints?\" \"If you\\'re telling the truth,\" he said, \"there\\'s almost certain to be some of your prints on the inside of that closet door -- maybe even on that length of metal, if we can find it.\" She said almost carelessly: \"That\\'s all you\\'d need to clear Paul Cordell, isn\\'t it?\" \"It would certainly help.\" He swung around in the chair, scooped up the telephone and gave a series of rapid-fire orders, then dropped the instrument on its cradle and turned back to where she sat watching him curiously. He said, \"A few things I still don\\'t get. Like this business of your standing two feet off the floor in a ball of blue light. And the flashes of light just before Cordell heard his wife and Gilmore fall to the floor. Even the snatches of conversation he caught while still in the hall. He couldn\\'t have dreamed all that stuff up -- at least not without some basis.\" She had opened her bag and taken out a cigarette. Kirk ignited one of his kitchen matches and she i bent her head for a light. He could see the flawless curve of one cheek and the smooth cap of blonde hair, and he resisted the urge to pass a hand lightly across both. Something was stirring inside the Lieutenant -- something that had long been absent. And, he reflected wryly, all because of a girl who had just finished confessing to two particularly unpleasant murders. Naia North raised her head and their eyes met -- met and held. Her lips parted slightly\\' as she caught the unmistakable message in those gray-blue depths... The moment passed, the spell was broken and she leaned back in  the chair and laughed a little shakily. \"I read about those statements of his in the papers, Lieutenant. I think perhaps I can at least partially explain them. As I remember it, there were several Bunsen burners lighted on the laboratory bench near that window\\'. They give off a blue flame, you know, and I must have been standing near them when Paul Cordell came charging in. In his confused frame of mind, he may have pictured me as being in a ball of flame.\" \"Sounds possible,\" the man admitted, frowning. \"What about those flashes of light?\" \"You\\'ve got me there. Unless they were reflections of sunlight through the window -- from the windshield of a passing car, perhaps.\" \"And the things he heard you and Gilmore saying?\" She shook her head regretfully. dark, I She went wit. in cruisers a hand slowly of his neck, \\'He could have conof metal in your hand as a gun,...

Why the confession?\" She said soberly: \"I was so sure they\\'d let him off. When you know someone\\'s innocent you can\\'t realize that others won\\'t know it too, I But when I learned he\\'d been found guilty and actually condemned to die... well, I know it sounds noble and all that but I couldn\\'t let him go to his death for d done.

Then Kirk was all right again, and he was looking at a woman who had just confessed to murder. You heard the phone call I made a moment ago, Miss North. Two men from the Crime Lab are already on their way to the University. If they find your fingerprints inside that closet, if they can. turn up anything to prove you\\'ve been in Gregory Gilmore\\'s laboratory, then you and that evidence and your confession get turned over to the D.

Criminal or unmoral or greedy or angry, yes. But not strange. She looked like other women -- only a lot better. She dressed like them, walked like them, talked like them. So why strange? Because she was strange. Nothing you could put your finger on made her that way, but that\\'s the way she was. He threw his cigar savagely into the fireplace. He went over and made another drink and poured it down fast and another one after it, right on its heels. Then he went to bed. Tomorrow -- today, rather -- was a work day and work days were tough days and he needed his rest. He didn\\'t get much of it, though. The phone woke him a few minutes after seven o\\'clock. It was Arthur Kahler Troy at the other end and the IX A. was too angry to be coherent. It seemed Naia North had disappeared from her locked cell during the night. fifiT don\\'t give a triple-distilled J, damn what you say!\" Troy snarled. \"Nobody\\'s got enough money to make that kind of payoff. Five men,. Lieutenant -- five men and five locked doors stood between that girl and the street. And you sit there and try to tell me somebodybought all five of \\'em off!\" \"Then,\" Kirk said heatedly, \"what\\'s your explanation?\" It had been going on this way for over an hour. The morning sun came in weakly at the window behind Troy\\'s huge polished mahogany desk, picking up random reflections from the collection of expensive gadgets littering the glass top. Troy began to wear another path in the moss-colored broadloom carpeting. He was big and broad and getting puffy around the middle, like a one-time halfback going to seed. His round, heavyfeatured face was even more .florid than usual, and his heavy growth of reddish-blond hair needed a comb. Martin Kirk pushed himself deeper into the depths of a brown leather chair and watched the D. A. through brooding eyes. He wanted a cigar but it was too early in the morning for that kind of inYou needed a breakfast and a couple cups of coffee before -- \"I don\\'t explain it,\" Troy said in quieter tones. He was standing by the window now, staring down into the boulevard passing that side of the Criminal Courts Building. \"It\\'s one of those tilings that make me think my sainted mother wasn\\'t so wrong when she used to tell z elves and gnomes and I I chauns and fairies and -- # Kirk made a sound deep in his throat, \"Naia North was a hell of a long way from being a leprechaun. Somebody wanted her out of here for some reason -- and they got her out. I want to know who took her out, why she was taken, and where she is now. And I\\'m going to find out the answers to all three if I have to turn this town on its ear.\" \"Go ahead,\" Troy said, \"Hop right to it and I wish you luck. Only leave me and my people out of it.\" \"Seems to me you\\'re mighty damned anxious to be left out.\" Arthur Kahler Troy turned on his heel and strode toward the Lieutenant until he was towering over him. \"just what,\" he said between his teeth, \"do you mean by that crack?\" \"Figure it out for yourself,\" Kirk snapped. \"And I\\'m sure you can.\" Troy reared back as though the police officer had pulled a gun on him. \"Why -- why you -- I\\'ll have you busted for making a dirty insinu -- \" \"You couldn\\'t bust a daisy chain at the police department,\" Kirk growled. \"The Commissioner hates your guts and you know that as well as I do. Now let\\'s cut out all this hokey-pokey and pick up a few loose ends. The first thing: what about Paul Cordell?\" All the wide-eyed fury seemed to go out of Troy\\'s face like water down the bathtub drain. He turned away and walked slowly back to his desk chair and sat down. He said, \"What about Cordell\\' in a soft voice. \"The morning paper,\" Kirk said, \"reports he was taken up to Hillcrest last night. The warden out there\\'s probably got him in Death Row already.\" \"Uh-hunh.\" \"Well, let\\'s get him out of there. With the evidence we\\'ve got, plus Naia North\\'s sworn statement, Judge Reed will have to bring him back down here and release him -- at least on bail until we can find the girl. The man\\'s innocent, Mr. D. A.; have you forgotten?\" \"Yes.\" \" \\'Yes\\'? Yes, what?\" \"I\\'ve forgotten he\\'s, innocent,\" Troy said quietly. \"Matter of fact, he\\'s guilty as hell\" T he lieutenant half rose from his chair. \"Now wait a minute! You heard that girl\\'s story and you\\'ve got the evidence I turned over to you right here in this office last night. What more -- \" \"I\\'ll tell you what more\\' Troy snapped. \"That girl was a fraud, her story was a downright lie and that evidence was faked. Let me tell you something else, Mister: within five minutes after the guard downstairs reported your girl friend missing, I had five squads of my men out running down the personal information she gave me a few hours before. And you know what they found out?. Every bit of what she told me was false! Hear that? False!

You didn\\'t want any part of this new development from the minute I called you on the phone last night.

He drummed his fingers over and over on the arm of his chair and listened to the every-day sounds of a normal day at the Homicide Bureau. A new day, a new set of problems, and why knock yourself out over some tiling that doesn\\'t concern you? Thing to do was go down to the comer tavern and have a couple of fast ones and watch an old movie on television. Yes sir, that\\'s exactly what he\\'d do! He went back to the mimeographed pages. For the fourth time he read through Cordell\\'s testimony of what had happened that October afternoon. And it was there that he came across the first possible break in the stone wall. Once more Martin Kirk went over the few lines, although by this time he could have come close to reciting them from memory. It was an excerpt from Arthur Kahler Troy\\'s cross-examination of the defendant after Cordell\\'s counsel, in a last desperate effort to swing the tide of a losing battle, had placed him on the stand. Q: (by Troy) : Now, Mr. Cordell, I direct your attention to the point in your testimony at which first entered Professor Gilmore\\'s outer office. At what time was this? A: At about #:# p.m. Q: Who was in the office at that time? A: Alma Dakin, the Professor\\'s secretary. And a couple of students -- although , they were at the other end of the room and I didn\\'t pay much attention to them . Q: But you did pay attention, as you call it, to Miss Dakin? A: Well, I spoke to her, if that\\'s what you mean. Q: That\\'s exactly what I mean, Mr. Cordell. And what was it you said to her? A: Something about it was too late in the day to be working so hard. Q: That was all? A: Yes, sir. Q: Remember, Mr. Cordell, you\\'re under oath. Now I ask you again : Was that all you said to her at that time? A: Yes, sir. Q: It isn\\'t possible you\\'ve forgotten some additional remark? Think carefully, please. A: No, sir. That\\'s all I said. I swear it. Q: Very well. Now how well do you know Miss Dakin? A: Just to speak to, Q: Have you ever seen her outside Professor Gilmore\\'s office? A: No, sir. Q: Ever ask her for a date? A: \\'No, sir. Q: Did you ever have an argument with her? A discussion of any kind that may have become a bit heated? A: No, sir. Q: Then to your knowledge she\\'d have no reason to dislike you? A: No, sir. Q: Very good. Now, Mr. Cordell, I want to read to you an excerpt from the testimony given by Miss Dakin in this court. \"Mr. Cordell was looking very angry when he came in. He came up to me and bent down over the desk and said so low I could hardly hear him: \\'Hi, Alma. You think the ProPs through making love to my wife?\\' \" I now ask you, Paul Cordell, isn\\'t that what you said to Alma Dakin? Not that shewas working too hard, or whatever it was you claimed to have said. A: No, sir. I didn\\'t say anything like she said I did. I wouldn\\'t insult my wife by saying such a thing to a third -- Q: Just answer the questions, Mr. Cordell. Then you contend that Miss Dakin deliberately lied in her testimony. A: She was mistaken. Q: Oh, come now! Miss Dakin is an intelligent girl; she couldn\\'t misunderstand or twist your words to that extent. Now could she? A: Then she lied. I never said anything like that. Q: What reason would she have for lying, Mr. Cordell? By your own statement she hardly knew you, always greeted you pleasantly on the times you came to the office, never got into any arguments with you, and never saw you outside the office. She had worked for Professor Gilmore for five or six months, has excellent references, and is well liked by her friends. Yet you\\'re asking us to believe that she coldly and deliberately lied to get you into trouble. Is that true? there all thought grimly, was innocent, then id the truth during the if he had told the truth to Alma Dakin, then, automatically, Alma Dakin\\'s testimony was untrue. Kirk ran his fingers through his in a gesture of bafflement. What possible reason could Gilmore\\'s secretary have for going out of her way to lie about Cordell\\'s remark? Was it because she was so certain he had killed her employer that she wanted to make sure he would be punished? Or was it because she wanted to shield the real killer? Maybe she was a friend of Naia North\\'s and had known the blonde girl was in Gilmore\\'s laboratory all along. She might even have deliberately steered everyone out of her office after Cordell discovered the bodies, making it possible for Naia to slip out unseen. was a slender lead, but the y one large enough to get even ngernail grip on.

When Miss Slife had run down, Kirk said, \"This Dr. Karney. Why did Miss Dakin leave him?\" The woman\\' at the other end of the wire seemed astonished by Kirk\\'s ignorance. \"Why, I assumed everybody knew about Dr. Karney. He died of a heart attack about eight months ago.\" What!\" U , there\\'s no need shout, Mr. Kirk.

He needed more evidence-evidence not to be explained away as coincidence. Once more Lieutenant Martin Kirk went back to  analyzing the broken phrases Cordell had picked up while eavesdropping that October afternoon. Twelve times zero made no sense at all .  . unless it could be the combination of a safe... ? Hardly possible ; no combination he\\'d ever heard of would read that way.

Kirk bit thou corner of his own any colleges an warnin word was college , where he ha le ference to the man in the street, but to the Professor... Wait a minute! Not colleges! Colleagues! It was his colleagues Gilmore had promised to warn. And the word meant men and women in the same line of work as the Professor -- nuclear physics. Things, Kirk told himself with elation, were looking up! The business about \"three in the past five months\" was next, but he felt sure of what that had meant. But the last of the quotations wnt nowhere at all. \"Something about taking in washing -- \" Under less tragic circumstances, a nonsense line. But Cordell hadn\\'t actually heard the words clearly enough to quote them with authority. That could mean he had heard words that problem,\" Kirk explained carelessly. \"Let\\'s say you hear a guy talking in the next room. You can\\'t really make out the words he\\'s saying, but right in the middle of his mumbling you hear what sounds like \\'taking in washing.\\' Now you know that can\\'t be right, so you try to think out what he actually did say... It was obvious Chenowich had fallen off on the first curve, so completely off that Kirk didn\\'t bother finishing what was much too involved to begin with. The patrolman was staring at him in monstrous perplexity. \"Jeez. Lieutenant. I don\\'t get it. \\'Less the guy\\'s goin\\' to open up one of these here laundries. That way he\\'d be takin\\' in washinh But I don\\'t know what else -- \" sounded like \"taking in washing.\" Taking, baking, making, slaking, raking -- the list seemed endless. \"Washing\" could have been the first two syllables of Washington -- and Washington would be the place where the Atomic Energy Commission hung out. Still too hazy. He leaned back and put his feet up and attacked the three mysterious words from every conceivable angle. No dice. S ight of the ambling figure of Patrolman Chenowich passing the office door caught his eye, reminding him that two heads were often better than one. \"Hey, Frank.\" Chenowich came in. \"Yeah, Kirk\\'s feet hit the floor with a solid thump and he grabbed Chenowich\\'s wrist with fingers that bit in like steel. \"Say that again!\" he shouted. \"Say it just that way!\" The patrolman recoiled in alarm. \"What\\'s got into you, Lieutenant? Say what?\" \"Taking in washing!\" \"Takin\\' in washin\\'? What for?\" Kirk\\'s grin threatened to split his face. \"The same words,\" he said, \"but you say them different. Only . your way\\'s the right way! Thanks, pal. Now get out of here!\" Chenowich went. His mouth was still open and his expression still troubled, but he went. The last of the killer\\'s cryptic remarks was now clear. For Kirk reLieutenant. Somethin\\' doin\\'?\" \"Fin trying to figure out a little alized that \"takin\\' \" rhymed with words you\\'d never associate with \"taking.\" \"Bacon\", for instance -- or \"Dakin\" S Alma Dakin, former secretary to two widely separated, and now dead, nuclear scientists. Her name had been mentioned by the slayer of Professor Gilmore only seconds before she had clubbed the savant to death. But now that \"taking\" had come out \"Dakin\" -- what did the rest of the phrase mean? Dakin in washing made no sense. What sounded like washing? Washing; washing... watching? It was close; in fact nothing he could think of came closer. right Dakin in watching ; no. Dakin is watching -- that made sense. But Alma Dakin hadn\\'t been watching anything at the time of dell, was at her desk in the outer office. That would leave Dakin was watching as the right combination. Watching for the right opportunity for murder I  What did it mean? Well, assuming from her past record that Alma Dakin was mixed up in the deaths of two prominent men of science, it argued that she and Naia North were accomplices in a scheme to rid America of her nuclear fission experts. The nice smooth story of quited love was probably as much a lie as the personal information Naia North had given Arthur Kahler Troy. The North girl had confessed to murdering Gilmore and Juanita Cordell. As a confessed killer she must be taken into custody and booked on suspicion of homicide. Taking her was Martin Kirk\\'s job -- and it seemed he had a contact that would lead him to her. Namely Alma Dakin. Lieutenant Kirk grabbed his hat and went out the door. Chapter V T he address for Alma Dakin turned out to be a small threestory walk-up apartment building on a quiet residential street near the outskirts of town. At two in the afternoon hardly anyone was visible on the sidewalks and only an occasional automobile passed. Kirk parked his car half a block further on down and got out into the chill November air. He entered the building foyer and looked at the name plates above the twin rows of buttons. The one for Alma Dakin told him the number of her apartment was #C. He pushed the button several times but without response. The foyer was very quiet at this time of day, and he could hear the faint rasp of her bell through the speaking tube. Kirk was on the point of shifting his thumb to the button marked superintendent when a sudden  thought stayed his hand. It was not the kind of thought a conscientious, rule-abiding police officer would harbor for a moment. The lieutenant, however, was fully aware he had no business working on a closed case to begin with -- and when you\\'re breaking one set of rules, you might as well break Cv u?

Sorry we bothered you, Kirk\\' let the door swing into place hard enough to be heard upstairs. But this \\'time he was on the right side of it. There was a moment of silence, then he caught the sound of retreating feet and a door closed. Without waiting further, the Lieutenant mounted the stairs to the third floor, his feet soundless on the carpeted treads. The entrance to #G was secured by a tumbler-type lock. From an inner pocket Kirk took out a small flat leather case and a thin-edged tool from that. Working with the of the expert, he the door moulding near inserted the tool blade the bolt.

In case at an mopporbe half way i while she was still en eased with lock. moulding back would be nothin ithin ten minutes Kn: every living room in search of somethin anything, that would point to Dakin as being more than a nine to-five secretary. And secretary found nothing, no one, not even the girl who lived here, could tell that an intruder had been at work. The bedroom seemed even less promising at first. Dresser drawers gave up only the pleasantly personal articles of the average young woman. Miss Dakin, it turned out, was almost indecently fond of frothy undergarments and black transparent nightgowns -- interesting but not at all important to the over-all problem. Kirk, his search completed, sat down on the edge of the bed\\'s footboard and totaled up what he had learned. It didn\\'t take long, for he knew absolutely no more about Alma Dakin than he fore entering her apartment personal papers, no letters yearning boy friend in t home town, no savings ing-account scrawled line of mas greetings the apartment\\'s To Kirk\\'s lack of such highly significant her bavin his already strong suspicion of her was solidified into certainty of her guilt. But certainty was a long way from rock-ribbed evidence -- and that was something he must have to proceed further. He was ready to leave when it dawned on him that he had not yet looked under the bed. Kneeling, he pushed up the hanging edge of the green batik spread and peered into the narrow space. Nothing, not even a decent accumulation of dust. The light from the window was too faint, however, to reach a section of the floor near the footboard. Kirk climbed to his feet and attempted to shove that end to one side.  The bed failed to move. He blinked in mild surprise and tried again. It was only by exerting, almost his entire strength that he was able to shift the thing at all, and then no more than a few inches. He felt his pulse stir with the thrill of incipient discovery. Once he made sure nothing was anchoring the bed to the floor, he began to tap lightly against the wood in an effort to detect a possible false panel. Within two minutes he located an almost microscopic crack in the headboard cleverly concealed by a decorative design running along the base. He ran his fingers lightly i along the carvings until they encountered a small projection which gave slightly under pressure. Kirk pressed down harder on the knob. A tiny click sounded against the silence and a section of wopd some three feet square swung out. Lifting it aside, the detective found himself staring at an instrument board of some kind with a series of buttons and dials countersunk into it. The board itself formed a part of what was obviously a machine of some sort which evidently contained its own power, for there seemed to be no lead-in cord for plugging into a wall socket. It could, Kirk thought, be a short wave radio transmitter. If it was, it looked like none he had ever , come across before. On the other hand it could be some sort of infernal machine, ready to blow half the city to bits at the turn of a dial. E ven as his mind was weighing the advisability of tampering with the thing, his fingers were reaching for the various controls. Gingerly he moved one or two of the dials but nothing happened. A little more boldly now, he began to depress the buttons. As the third sank in, a low humming sound began to fill the room. Before Kirk could find a cut-off switch of some kind, the faint light of day streaming through the room\\'s one window winked out, plunging him into a blackness so infinitely deep that it was like being buried alive. Nothing can plunge a man into the sheerest panic like the absence of light. Even a man like Martin Kirk, who had walked almost daily with danger for the past fifteen \\' years. And since the form panic takes varies with the individual, the Lieutenant\\'s reaction was an utter inability to move so much as a finger. Abruptly the low humming note a human vvt ( dials an h the words h ad  ever in his brain, Kirk\\'s ;nded.

The humming note came back, then ceased -- and without warning daylight from the window washed over the bewildered and thoroughly frightened police officer. Not until five minutes had passed was Martin Kirk sufficiently in control of his nervous system to even attempt replacing the loose panel in the headboard. When at last he managed to do so, he returned the bed to its original position, closed and bolted the kitchen one last look around to make sure nothing was out of place, out of the apartment, time he was back behind I of his car and had cigar, Kirk\\'s brain function with some\\' ability. He sat s collar, trying to significance of lours events. onger any doubt in this mess as she was to the murders vinced heart do with it) would have eign agent bent America\\'s defense: thing. That machine, mind that could gether a mechanism not of this planet. Paul Cordell\\'s story floated in a ball of blue fire soun like the ravings of a brain. And the seeming miracle Naia North\\'s escape from a cell block now passed from fantasy to the factual. What to do about it? Martin Kirk, at this moment undoubtedly the most bewildered man alive, put his head in his hands and tried to reach a decision. Take his story to the Police Commissioner? It would r mean a padded cell -- and without even bothering to see if Alma Dakin possessed a machine more complicated than an electric iron. Some government agency? By the time the red tape was unsnarled the former secretary could have reached Pakistan on foot. Slowly from the depths terror of the Unknown, Kirk\\'s training in police proce began to make itself started to form -- hazy at in a sharp and orderly # to the of his bad cisive orders duced the ; of almost the law. It sister livside of town who put her up for traveling bag in one fist, hour was gone in response to a skidded a a stop at the curb a block e building. He delivered a dictograph to his superior, listened a grim warning to keep his mouth shut about this at Headquarters, asked a couple of questions that drew no answers, and departed as swiftly as he had come. The next step was the dangerous one. The superintendent admitted Kirk to the Dakin apartment and went down to the. foyer to ring the bell in case the girl arrived at the wrong time. He soothed the Lieutenant\\'s anxiety somewhat by explaining that she seldom returned the place before seven o\\'clock, over three hours from now, but Kirk was taking no chances. y five o\\'clock he had Alma s bedroom  bugged and the working order and He was painsremoving all traces of sawdust and bits of the dresser cover the diefoyer and #D to take up He was in the s room, workin ,, earphones in he heard, the sound o; door closing in the next a The time was #:#. Chapter t was like being in her room with his eyes shut. The soft scraping of drawers opening and closing, the creak of a chair being sat in, the cushioned thump of shoes dropped to the carpeted floor, even the rustle of a nylon slip as she drew it over her head. It seemed much too early for her to turn in for the night. Was he going to be forced to sit there and listen to twelve or fourteen hours of feminine snoring? It would be damned unlikely in view of what was a cinch to be running through her mind, f Minutes later he heard her leave the bedroom, followed the muted roar of a shower. After that had laste mal length of time ceased and naked on the bedroom, more opening ; ers, the whispe donned, and sound like lass which he part of the If there was anything of a panicky nature in her movements it would take better ears than his to detect it. But for Alma Dakin to get away with her kind of job required the nerves of lion trainer no matter what pressures she was subjected to. Kirk stretched his legs, dug a cigar from the breast pocket of his coat and got it burning, then went back to the crossword puzzle with half his attention, keeping alert for any significant sound from the other apartment. His years as a minion of the law had adequately conditioned him to the utter boredom that went with the ordinary stake-out. Several times the subject left the bedroom, but he was able to pick up sounds familiar enough to trace as emanating from the living room or kitchen. But nothing she did was worthy of notice in the home-town paper or even on the margin of a police blotter. A t #:# Alma Dakin again entered the bedroom. A hunch, or a sixth sense, or whatever years of experience in a single field gives a man, told Kirk that this time something would pop. He put aside the newspaper, placed a sheet of blank paper on the cover of a historical romance lifted from the spinster\\'s nightstand, and got out a pencil, A motor whined unexpectedly from the opposite side of the apartment wall and he could hear a heavy object roll with well-oiled smoothness a short distance across the carpet. He decided it was the bed being moved out from the wall by mechanical means rather than muscle, and it was clear to him now how she was able to get at that hidden radio, or whatever it was. For the second time that day Kirk heard that eerie humming -- a sound, he realized, that ordinarily would have been completely inaudible beyond the girl\\'s bedroom walls. Suddenly the hum was chopped off and a familiar voice spoke familiar words. I \"Mythox. Contact established. Proceed.\" \"A message for Orin. Alma Dakin\" A series of almost undetectable clicking sounds; then: \"Alma?\" Despite the fact that the voice was coming through an amplifier, there was no distortion. \"Anything wrong?\" It was a man\\'s voice, clear, vibrant, young, and with no trace of an alien accent. Kirk\\'s theory\\' of an interplanetary\\' menace lost some of its strength. \"I -- I\\'m not sure, Orin,\" the girl said hesitantly. \"There was a policeman at my apartment today -- the same one Naia went to; The building superintendent told me,\" \"That\\'s odd. There\\'s no way you can be tied in with her. Or is there ?\" \"Not that I know of, Orin. Unless they\\'ve decided to check back on me just for the sake of some-, thing to do. If that\\'s what\\'s happened and they\\'ve learned I was working for Dr. Karney at the time of his death, they may get an idea the three deaths are related. And once a police officer gets suspicious, he can hound you unmercifully. That\\'s what worries me, Orin. You know Fm not really an accomplished liar!\" . I \"Shall we bring you here? At least long enough to build you a new identity?\" A pause. Then the girl\\'s voice again: \"Something else puzzles me, too. There\\'s no mention of Naia\\'s confession in the newspapers.\" \"What? You mean they haven\\'t released Cordell? What will Tamu say?\" \"If they have, nobody knows about it. I told you Naia should have remained in their hands until the young man was set free. You don\\'t know my people as I do. Orin -- none of you do.\" \"But the evidence? Nobody, not even the most stupid of Earthmen, could have ignored that evidence! Tamu won\\'t like this.\" \"I can\\'t help it, Orin. I keep telling you, Orin: you must use a new set of standards for this world. If its people thought as yours do, none of these unpleasant things would have to happen.\"  A nother pause before the man\\'s voice came over Kirk\\'s earphones. \"We didn\\'t dare leave Naia in their hands. That\\'s why we brought her back here. Look at the chance we took by permitting them to hold her even briefly. If only she hadn\\'t blundered in the first place... \" His voice trailed off, then came back suddenly brisk. \"Well, too late for regrets. We won\\'t risk letting them question you. Field Seven in, say, three hours. Time enough?\" \"More than enough!\" Her relief was unmistakable. \"It\\'ll be wonderful visiting Mythox again, Orin. I hope Methu will allow me to stay for a long time.\" t \"I hope so too, darling. But our work comes first; none of us dares let down for even a moment... See you soon. And don\\'t neglect to eliminate the contrabeam.\" \"It will be gone seconds after we break contact. Field Seven at -- let\\'s see -- #:#.\" \"I\\'ll be there. Farewell, Alma.\" The dim humming came back again, followed briefly by no sound at allf Then there was the noise of drawers being opened and closed with a kind of brisk and cheerful haste. Alma Dakin was preparing to take it on the lam! , Martin Kirk knew he had only a limited time to plan his own course of action. One way was to walk into the adjoining apartment, place Alma Dakin under arrest and force the whole story from her. A moment\\'s reflection, however, caused him to abandon the idea. Any such move would end his chances of getting his hands on Naia North. More than anything else he wanted her, and he closed his mind to the broader aspects of what had taken -- and was still taking -- place. No, his job was to follow Alma Dakin to her rendezvous with this man Orin and in some way force the two of them into turning Naia North over to him. This time she\\'d stick around long enough to stand trial -- even if he had to handcuff her to the bars of her cell ! From beyond the wall he .caught the sounds of suitcases being snapped shut, followed by the fading echo of footsteps. He jerked the earphones from his head and went quickly to the hall door in time to catch a glimpse of Alma Dakin on her way to the building stairs, a bulging suitcase in each hand. Kirk raced for the kitchen of #D, flung open the door and went down the rear steps with astonishing agility. He was opening the door of his car by the time the girl came out of the front entrance. He watched her place the bags in the trunk of a small sand-colored coupe, then slip in behind its wheel and start the motor. The coupe passed his parked car, turned the corner and disappeared. Before it had reached the next intersection, Kirk was rolling smoothly half a block to her rear. Two hours later both cars were moving along a winding country road miles from civilization. Kirk was driving without lights, bad enough under favorable circumstances but sheer folly considering the sky was completely overcast, so that he was denied even the faint radiance of the stars. Fortunately there was no other traffic in this desolate section at eleven o\\'clock at night, so that his only danger was in failing to remain on the twisting road. in ally, , near the crest of a particularly steep hill, two flaring red lights warned him his quarry was applying the brakes of her car. He cut ins engine long enough to hear the coupe\\'s motor die, then he swung his wheel to the right and coasted to a halt on the soft shoulder of the road. Under cover of bushes and trees, naked of foliage at this time of the year, Kirk worked his way silently ahead until\\' he could make out the dim figure of the girl as she dragged the pair of bags from the boot. Without a backward glance, she turned away from the road and an instant later was lost to sight among the trees. There was nothing of the frontiersman in Lieutenant Martin Kirk, but fortunately the same was true of Alma Dakin. Where anyone accustomed to moving across natural terrain could have lost the officer with ease, in her case he need only pause briefly from time to time and use his ears. At last the seemingly interminable forest ended and the girl sank wearily down on an upended suitcase. Kirk, perspiring freely under the folds of his topcoat, halted in the shelter of a\\' tree bole, and waited. Beyond where the girl sat was a large natural clearing covered with a fringe of winter grass. The silence was close to being absolute; only the faint keening of a chill wind and the restless creak of barren branches kept it from becoming unbearable. Gradually his eyes became more and more accustomed to the absence of light worthy of the name, and he began to identify objects as something more than formless na er :te. the akin appeared to  him than he had d her slim back I when she lighted vind bringing the co to his nostrils, he lv have strangled her torture. by.

He was through in # out on a windv hill like tire night air abc and he was starin circular structure as Before the Lieutenant could get his jaw off his necktie, Alma Dakin had uttered a cry of relief and was racing toward the nearest edge of the gleaming vessel. A panel in its side slid noiselessly back and the tall figure of a man was outlined in the opening. \"Alma!\" he shouted and sprang to the ground to meet her. They came together almost violently midway between the clearing\\'s edge and the ship. She clung to him as he bent his head to meet her lips. Kirk glanced past them at the open portal. Dim light from within cast a soft glow against the night. Nothing moved in the narrow segment of the interior visible from where he was standing. And Kirk had a moment of what was as close to fear as he was able to know. A little time of bewilderment when his guard slipped just a trifle. What in the hell was all this? Into his solid world had come strange and unreasonable things. Crazy ships, and people who didn\\'t play according to the rules he had learned over thankless drudging years as an honest cop. A few tiny beads of sweat formed on his upper lip. Then Ms stubborn, inherent fatalism came to his aid. He grinned without humor. The hell with it. Whatever came up -- a screwball flying saucer or a berserk psycho waving a gun. You played it the same; according to your own rules. This thing, whatever it was, bridged the gap to a killer. And when you found such a bridge, you crossed it. M .rtin kirk, his gun clutched tightly, movedlike a casual shadow, eased his way along the hull of ship and slipped inside. He had never seen anything like this. The lighting for one thing. It came from nowhere and somehow the stuff had a mood. It seemed alive -- an intelligent force watching him, mocking him, sneering at him. And so potent was the mood of the whole setup, so sharp his need of release that he muttered, \"The hell with you,\" and softly followed a circular corridor which curved off the hull. They were coming toward the ship, Orin and Alma -- coming while he still hunted a hole. He kept on going. If he met anybody they were going tago down. But he didn\\'t. He found a steel stairway and a pocket at its base to hold his body. It wasn\\'t a dark pocket. Light was everywhere. But the stairway hid him and the pair passed by and went on down the corridor. He realized his right hand was aching and relaxed his grip on the gun butt he clutched. He straightened up and the tense little mirthless grin played on his lips. Okay. Now where was she and howdid it work? Could he find her and haul her off silly tilt-awhirl? He thought not. Either his eyes were bad or this thing had appeared from nowhere. Something inside snapped: Quit thinking that way! Whatever it looked like -- think right. Follow the rules. Look for the dame. His grin deepened. Sure. He started walking. Around the eerie corridor in the direction opposite that taken by Orin and Alma Dakin. He walked a long time and there were no doors or anything else so the only thing to do was keep walking. He thought: When I come to that stairway I\\'ll be back where I started but where\\'s that? What good is a hall you keep going around and around in? The ship lurched and threw him to the floor. It was going somewhere. But it didn\\'t go anywhere. Of that he was sure. Maybe he\\'d been fooled but it seemed the ship settled back after that single lurch and lay there like a choice segment out of someone\\'s pet nightmare. Kirk got to his feet and rubbed the place his leg had violently met the floor. He walked on and there was the steel stairway again and it was all very damned silly because he knew he\\'d circled the times. But lucky because the footsteps sounded again and as he dived toward the pocket, the wall of the ship opened to form a doorway. They forgot something, he thought. What kind of supermen are these? They can build a ship that has a stairway every third trip around and still they go away and forget things,  The grin \\'was tighter than ever. Whistle in the dark, boy, but admit it -- you\\'re scared. Sure, but what\\'s that got to do with it? . Orin and Alma left the ship. Martin Kirk pushed his head around the staircase. He crouched ship at least three  for sometime, staring through the open segment of the hull at the outside world. And his poor stupid orthodox mind asked a pitifully logical question: How could it get light, with the sun at high noon, in fifteen minutes? After a long, motionless time, the silence became such a roaring thing in Kirk\\'s ears he could stand it no longer. He got up and walked to the doorway. Something had gone somewhere; either the ship or the world he\\'d known, because out there was a different world and he knew damn well he\\'d never seen it before. M artin kirk stepped out into a circle of lush vegetation. And in doing so, he learned something. He learned that the human mind is a far more adaptable mechanism than most people imagine; that they can pelt you with goof balls and you get sweat on your iip and have to talk to yourself to keep from sliding off your rocker, but after a while when your mind seems halfway over the edge, it straightens up suddenly and starts going along. A defense mechanism against insanity? He didn\\'t know. He only knew that when the tiger roared, he whirled around with his gun leveled, saw the sixinch teeth, got wholesomely and sanely scared, and then everything was all right. He knew he was all right when he got the right reaction from sight of the almost naked girl holding the tiger. For a long moment it was a frozen-action tableau. The huge orange and black beast. The wide eyed young brunette nudist, and the tropical forest with the great big fart sun overhead. The girl\\'s voice nailed it all down. \"Don\\'t be afraid. Rondo won\\'t hurt you.\" Kirk\\'s resentment flared warmly and, had resentment been a tangible thing, he would have kissed it. \"You\\'re tootin\\' right he won\\'t, sister. This isn\\'t a toy Fm holding.\" \"Rondo is very gentle.\" Kirk eyed the girl. \"Why don\\'t you put some clothes on?\" Her teeth were as bright and even as little white knives but her smile took the edge off them. \"Only people in the city wear clothes. I wear them when I\\'m in the city. When I come out here I -- \" \" -- you don\\'t wear any clothes. Tell me -- where am I?\" \"Don\\'t you know?\" \"Let\\'s not play games. If I knew f wouldn\\'t ask you.\" \"Did you come on the ship?\" \"You saw me get out of it didn\\'t you? Now answer my question.\" And he realized how certain he was of what her answer would be. \"On Mythox.\" \"Well fancy that. \\'Now tell me something else. Do you know what  language you\\'re speaking?\" \"Of course. English.\" \"And why should you speak English on Mythox? Haven\\'t you got a language of your own?\" \"Certainly. Rut you\\'re obviously from Earth. I thought you were a Watcher. I tried English. If you hadn\\'t responded I\\'d have spoken to you in the other Earth languages.\" \"How many do you know?\" I \"Eleven hundred and seventeen. With various dialects, four thousand and -- \"  \"There aren\\'t that many.\" She looked puzzled. Then her face cleared. \"Oh you mean Earth languages. I was referring to those of the Five Galaxies.\" I\\'m not going to be surprised at anything, he told himself doggedly. Not at anything. \"Do you know anyone named Naia North?\" T here was a childlike seriousness in her manner. It tended to deny the maturity of her body. Or was it the other way around? Martin Kirk wasn\\'t sure, and grimly assured himself that he didn\\'t give a damn. The girl said, \"I don\\'t know anyone by that name. But I could find her for you.\" \"How would you go about it?\" \"I\\'d go to the city and check the video-directory, naturally.\" \"Naturally. And you\\'d put your clothes on before you went?\" \"Of course I would. We go without clothing only out here in the playground.\" Kirk realized he\\'d been holding the gun rigidly in front of him. The tiger had dropped to the ground and lay outstretched like a lazy, good-natured dog. Kirk lowered the gun, setting his eyes again on the girl. \"A minute ago you said you thought I was a Watcher. What did you mean?\" He would have framed his questions with more guile, but something told him it wasn\\'t necessary. This child of nature was utterly without guile. She said, \"An Earth Watcher. What did you think I meant?\" \"I didn\\'t know or I wouldn\\'t have asked.\" It clarified. Dakin is watching. Sure. What the hell else would a Watcher do but watch? But why, and for what? Kirk was mystified. But it didn\\'t matter, he asserted inwardly, and turned his mind back to the straight line. The cop\\'s line. \"Will you put on your clothes and go into the city and locate Naia North for me?\" \"If it will help you\" \"It will. Where can I wait for you?\" \"If you want to see Naia North why don\\'t you come with me?\" Kirk shrugged. Why not? So long as the score was completely unknown to him, why not follow the path of least resistance? \"Get your clothes on,\" he said. The girl turned and started leading the tiger back toward a grove of trees. After a few steps she turned back, a look of sober thought on her face. \"Are all Earthlings so assertive?\" she asked. Kirk grinned. As long as it works, this one is, baby. But what if it stops working? His reply was not audible and the girl turned finally to disappear into the bushes. Kirk then experienced a strange feeling of unreality which persisted until the girl returned. TVT Y name is Raima,\" the wore tight-fitting trousers, a loose blouse and had a silver colored air car with room in back for the tiger. Kirk knew it was an air car whc;i the craft lifted from the ground from no apparent means of acceleration and skimmed along just above the trees. He sat beside Raima and asked, \"About that ship I came here in? How fast does it travel and how far is it from Mythox to Earth?\" \"The distance is around two hundred thousand light years but the ship doesn\\'t really travel at all.\" \"Maybe you could go into a little more detail,\" Kirk said wearily. \"It\\'s very simple. Distance, as you Earthlings regard it, is not distance at all. Space bends to a greater or lesser degree depending upon its immediate function in whatever time-space equation you are using.\" \"Thank you very much,\" Kirk replied and silently added: Keep to the line. Hold to your own values. On Earth, wherever it is, a J  r man is waiting to go to the chair for a murder he didn\\'t commit. Use whatever equation you want to -- that still adds up the same. These people may be a lot smarter than you are, but they can\\'t twist that one and make you believe it comes out anv different. A strange city of graceful flying spirals was coming over the horizon. It moved closer and the air car arced in to a halt on a huge cement landing area punctuated with small circles of a different material. Raima jumped from the cockpit .s ear the soft paws landing ? ent over and the circles. in the city and image wi. As Kirk watche  Don\\' t you want to street level?\\' stupid of me beside the slapped the The circle dropped silently bein a bright metal tube a door soon appeared to out into a broad street  with casually moving pedes-. Kirk noted that none of them seemed in any hurry; that here and there was an individual dressed like himself. Watchers on furlough or vacation, he thought a trifle bitterly. This picture was far from complete but enough of it added up to furnish a name for them. uizling was a good one. Perhaps\" traitor was better. All in all, he found one satisfaction. He could travel about as he huge of short walk brought them to a four or five story wall, the like had never seen.

She\\'s pretty, isn\\'t she?\" Naia North was entirely composed. She wore a pale blue gown and from the background in the mirror, Kirk gathered that she was at home. \"Aren\\'t you surprised?\" Kirk asked. Now a slight frown creased the lovely Naia\\'s brow. \"A little perhaps. How did you get to Mythox? And why did you come?\" \"A slight matter of murder. A murder you confessed to, or has it slipped your mind?\" \"Aren\\'t you being rather absurd? That\\'s all done with.\" \"Not so far as Paul Cordell is concerned. He\\'s going to the only he isn\\'t.

Then you took a powder. Now\\' you sneer in my teeth. What do you use for a rudder, sweetheart.\" \"I followed orders,\" Naia flared with a mixture of anger and sullenness. \"I am now free of the assignment.\" Kirk pursed his lips thoughtfully. \"You wouldn\\'t be sort of a hatchetwornan for this high-blown outfit would you? I can think offhand of a few other names. Karney, Blatz, Kennedy. What gives with knocking off nuclear physicists, baby?\" Naia did not answer. When she started to turn away from the mirror , Kirk glanced at the silent Raima standing with her hand on the tiger\\'s head. \"Is there any way I can call on the lady in the mirror personally?\" \"Not if she doesn\\'t want to receive you,\" Raimu said. She was studying Kirk with wistful dark eyes. \\' Naia turned back quickly. \"Fll be glad to receive you. It\\'s time I taught you a lesson.\" \"Fine. What\\'s your address?\" But Naia was gone. The little mirror turned opaque. Kirk shot a questioning glance at Raimu. \"Does yes mean no on this cockeyed planet?\" \"Her car will come.\" Raimu murmured. But the petite dark beauty seemed interested in other things. \"You didn\\'t tell me your name.\" \"Sorry. Rude of me. It\\'s Martin Kirk. You\\'ve been pretty nice to me. I wish there was some way I could show my appreciation,\" \"You\\'re going to see Naia North?\" \"Yes. She\\'s a murderess. I\\'m taking her back to my planet.\" \"I\\'m afraid that wouldn\\'t be possible.\" \"You too, honey?\" Kirk reached out and flicked one of the raven curls. \"If things were different you and I might be able to have fun.\" \"I spend a lot of time -- where you found me. Maybe -- \" \"I doubt if I can make it. But keep your clothes on after this -- as a personal favor to me.\" She was the very soul of solemnity. \"I don\\'t understand you. I really don\\'t understand you at all.\" At that moment, an air car --  much smaller than Raimu\\'s, dropped gently into the street beside Kirk. \"Good lord! Did this thing smell me out?\" \"It came to the mirror on Naiads private wave-length. Get in. It will way. The mocking smile was still on take you to her.\" her face. \"Did you trip?\" Kirk crawled into the car. The Kirk got groggily to his feet. \"No, last thing he saw before it lifted into angel. That\\'s the way I always cross the air, were Raimu\\'s dazzling a room.\" As he came upright his black eyes. The last words he heard hand reached toward the bulge were, \"Goodbye. Martin Kirk. I made by his shoulder holster. Rut will visualize you.\" it didn\\'t get that far.

And in Kirk\\'s mind: Dumb babe. What\\'s she got to be scared of? They hit you with nothing and make it stick. Kirk croaked, \"Grab your bag, baby. We\\'ll go find that flying biscuit. We got a date with Arthur Kahler Troy.\" He was really cagey this time. When the light beam shot out, he hurled himself to the side. But he could have saved the effort. A beam came from the other door jamb and he stepped right into it. That one really tore his head off. S omebody was talking. It was a man and he had a deep resonant voice: a voice full of authority -- and censure. \"Im surprised at you Naia. I never suspected you of having a sadistic streak.\" Naia\\'s sullen reply. \"Do you think anyone can do the work I do and remain unmarked?\" \"I suppose not. But as I remember it, you asked to serve.\" \"As a benefit to humanity.\" \"We won\\'t go into it.\" But Naia pressed the point. \"I have always followed orders. I placed myself in possible jeopardy on Earth by clearing Paul Cordell.\" \"But Paul Cordell was not cleared.\" \"Not through any fault of mine.\" \"But why this? What end does torturing this poor unfortunate serve?\". Martin Kirk cautiously opened one eye. It brought to his brain the image of a large blue globe, A man of fine and commanding appearance stood within the globe, suspended about a foot from the floor. The globe and the man gave every indication of having just come through the opaque glass wall of the room, and as Kirk watched, the man was lowered slowly to the floor and the globe became a blue mist that spiralled lazily and was gone. Kirk opened both eyes now, stirred, and climbed dizzily to his feet. \"You bump into the damndest tilings around here,\" he said. \"But let\\'s get down to the important business. My name is Martin Kirk. I\\'m an American police officer. One of your subjects committed a murder on American soil. I hope you aren\\'t going to be difficult about extradition.\" The other could not hide his surprise. Nor did he try to. \"Amazing,\" he murmured. Then, \"I am Tamil, the overlord of the galaxy. I wonder if Naia\\'s cruelty hasn\\'t affected your mind?\" \"If you mean I\\'m nuts, I think maybe you\\'re right. But it wasn\\'t little Playful here who did it. I\\'ve gone through a lot and I don\\'t speak with any sense of bragging. I\\'ve seen more furiny things happen than any one man should see in so short a time. So maybe I am off my rocker. So I\\'d like your permission to take my prisoner back to Earth so I can give all my time to regaining my sanity.\" Tarau regarded Kirk with thoughtful eyes. \"I think we should have a talk.\"  \"I would like a talk. I would like nothing better than to chew the fat with you for hours on end if my jaw didn\\'t hurt so damned much. So PH just take my prisoner and go. Do I have to sign a paper or something?\" The overlord\\'s surprise was fast becoming a kind of fascinated awe. \"Kirk, you said?\" He pointed to the door leading to the inner room. \"Please go in, sir. There\\'s no use of our standing out here while we discuss your problem.\" The Lieutenant eyed the door frame warily. \"I tried getting through there before but the light got in my eyes!\" \"You can trust me.\" The police officer stepped cautiously through the opening and on into a luxuriously furnished room. Tamu, dressed much the same as one of Earth\\'s better bankers, followed him in and suggested he sit down. \"Why?\" Kirk demanded bluntly. \"Let\\'s stop kitten-and-micing around, Mr. Tarnu. I\\'m not comfortable here and I want to leave. With her.\" He tilted his head toward the watching, sullen-faced Naia North. \"And now.\" Tamu said, \"Believe me, it will be as easy for you to return to Earth an hour from now. You seem weary to the point of exhaustion. I ask you again: sit down and get back some of your strength. Naia will find you something to eat.\" Kirk\\'s stubborn determination to force an immediate showdown wavered. It had been born largely of fear to begin with, and  the thought of relief for his burning throat was impossible to resist. \"I could use a drink,\" he admitted. Tamu gestured and Naia North turned to leave the room. But Kirk leaped forward to block her off. \"Nothing doing! I don\\'t take my eyes off you, baby. I\\'ll just pass up that drink.\" The girl glanced at the overlord and shrugged helplessly. Tamu said, \"Have a girl bring in something. While we\\'re waiting I suggest all three of us get comfortable.\" While Naia was speaking into a tiny screen set into one of the silkcovered walls, Tamu and the man from Earth sat down across from each other on a pair of fragilelegged chairs. The overlord leaned back and sighed. \"You\\'ve asked my leave to return to Earth and to take Naia back with you to stand trial for murder. Have you considered that I may refuse that permission?\" \"I don\\'t think I have to consider it,\" Kirk said promptly. \"You don\\'t?\" Tamu was mystified again. \"Why not?\" \"You tell me you\\'re the overlord. I take that to mean you\\'re in charge. That means you have laws to govern your people and that means you believe in laws. One of your subjects has broken the law of my country. You can\\'t refuse to let her take the consequences any more than if the situation was reversed.\" Tamu was shaking his head and smiling slightly. \"I\\'m afraid you\\'re not taking into consideration on fact, Mr. Kirk. Naia North broke your law, as you call it, on express and definite instructions from me.\" Martin Kirk made a show of astonishment. \"Let me get this straight. You ordered Professor Gilmore and Juanita Cordell murdered? Is that what you\\'re telling me?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" \\' \"Exactly the reason I suggested we have a talk. To make you see why they -- and others in the same classification -- could not be allowed to live.\"  , \\' \"Men like Karney? Kennedy? Blatz?\" Tamu blinked. \"My respect for you increases, Martin Kirk.\" \"Don\\'t let it throw you. I\\'m a police officer, and police officers are trained to do the job right.\" The overlord crossed his legs and settled deeper into the chair. \"Mythox needs men like you, Martin Kirk. That is why I\\'m going to give you a chance for life. For this you must understand: if I wanted it, you would be dead within seconds.\" A chill slid along the stubborn back of the Lieutenant but nothing showed in his impassive expression and he did not speak. \"But because we do need you, I am going to tell you things no Earthman knows. I believe that once you understand why Mythox has undertaken to meddle in the affairs of another world -- and I tell you frankly that our doing so is as abhorrent to us as anything you can imagine -- once you understand our reasons, you will cheerfully, even eagerly, join us,\" \"And if I don\\'t?\" . \"You know the answer to that, A I\\'m sure.\" A slim fairhaired girl in a pale green toga-like dress entered the room carrying a tray holding tall glasses of some sparkling blue beverage. She offered it first to Kirk, then the others. The Lieutenant removed one of the glasses, wajted until Tamu and Naia had done the same, but not until they had drunk some of the liquid did he tilt his own glass. The cold tangy liquid hit him like a bombshell -- a bombshell on the pleasant side. He could almost literally feel his strength flow back, his senses sharpen and the poisons of fatigue and mental strain disappear. \"I\\'m listening,\" he said. Tamu set his glass on the edge of a nearby table and bent forward, his manner earnest. \"It won\\'t take long. Martin Kirk. Hear me. We of Mythox are far in advance of the peoples of Earth -- both spiritually and scientifically. Life on our plhnet materialized in much the same manner as on your own world, but countless ages before. Almost the same process of evolution took place ; but somewhere along the line humanity on \\'Mythox managed to reach full development without the flaws of character found among so many of Earth\\'s inhabitants.

If they persisted down that path, it was bound to follow that they would attempt the thing we feared : the splitting of hydrogen atoms -- the hydrogen bomb, as you call it. \"We know what that would mean: a chain reaction that would wipe out an entire galaxy in one blinding flash.

Fortunately for our purpose only a relative few have progressed along a line which can lead to danger for the rest. Yours is one of those which has -- and that is why we of Mythox have taken a well-masked place in your affairs so far as they relate to nuclear physics. \"Every scientist of your world, male or female, is constantly under the eye of a Watcher. These Watchers are members of your own races -- people we have enlisted in the fight to save not just their world \"When a W atcher learns a physicist is close to the one key to success in his effort to make a hydrogen bomb -- an equation that begins: \\'Twelve times zero point seven nine\\' -- we are notified and a killer from our own people is sent to execute that scientist. Yes, Martin Kirk, we have those among us -- a very few -- who are capable of killing on orders and for cause. Naia, here, is one of them. She was sent to take the lives of Gregory Gilmore and Juanita Cordell; but she bungled and instead of their deaths resembling heart failure, they were obviously murdered. \"Alma Dakin tried to cover up the truth by making it appear both scientists had died at the hands of a jealous husband. She succeeded, both because of her perjured testimony and the fact that Paul Cordell insisted on telling the truth. But when we of Mythox learned what had happened, Naia was sent back to confess the crime. She entered the laboratory only a few hours before she came...to your office; while she was in the laboratory the second time, the clues you found were put there. \"Our mistake was in thinking that, once proof was offered clearing Cordell, the innocent man would be freed. For once more we credited Earthlings with the same code of ethics we of Mythox adhere to. \"You succeeded in following Naia here. Only a man composed of equal parts of Earth bulldog and genius could have done so. Martin Kirk, I offer you a place among us and a lifetime devoted to making sure the galaxy of which we both are a part does not perish. What say you?\" Several minutes dragged by. The eyes of both Tamu and Naia North were glued, to the grim visage of Homicide Lieutenant Kirk. It was impossible for either of them to know what thoughts were churning behind that stone face. Abruptly he stood up. \"I\\'m a cop. I leave your kind of problem to the people who are good at it. My people, Tamu. You see, I belong to my world, not to yours. \"But you\\'ve got a solid argument -- one I\\'d be a fool not to consider. Let me sleep n it. Tomorrow morning we\\'ll talk about it some more; then I\\'ll give you my answer. Right now I\\'m too worn out to think in a straight line.\" \"Of course.\" The overlord rose to his feet. \"Find Martin Kirk comfortable quarters, Naia, and leave orders he is not to be disturbed until he is ready to join us.\" On his way down a corridor behind the same slip of a girl who had brought him his drink, Martin Kirk was thinking: They didn\\'t even frisk me for a gun! Martin Kirk went into his apartment and lay for a while looking at the ceiling. After a time, he got up and went out again. Chapter IX T he soft silvery radiance which this planet seemed to feature, bathed the metal hallway as Kirk marched stolidly toward the slim arcing stairway that led toward Naia\\'s floor. This was certainly a strange building, he thought. The architects of Mythox knew how to use curves. They utilized them for utility and beauty to a point where a straight line was something to be surprised at. Pretty smart people, the Mythoxians -- in more ways than one. And Kirk, for no apparent reason, thought of a phrase comnion among children during his own childhood. \"Who died and left you boss?\" He counted the markings over one door. He had seen those markings before. Naia North lived here. And Naia North was in. Kirk walked softly across the large foyer room and quietly pushed open a door to the left. Naia, clad as always, in beauty, lay sleeping on a bed that stood out from the wall on two narrow rods of metal and needed no other support. As Kirk opened his mouth, Naia awakened, so she was looking calmly at him as he spoke. \"Up, baby. You\\'ve got a date with a hot electrode a lot of light years from here. It\\'s a hike, so rise and shine.\" , Naia sat up very slowly, very gracefully. She was what men dream of finding in bed beside them. What they marry to keep in bed beside them. \"You must be mad\" \"As a hatter, baby. Into your duds.\" He saw her glance at the door jamb of the bedroom entrance, saw the shadow of disappointment in her lovely eyes. \"You didn\\'t put those Joe Louis light rays in your bedroom, did you?\" Naia set her feet on the floor and drew herself to her full height. She wore light blue, a gown that hung as had that of Guinevere, as that of the Maid of Shalot. But Naia was contempt. She was contempt clothed in cold blue then contempt naked as she allowed the gown to fall to the floor. A few minutes later, she was contempt clothed for the street in tight britches and a loose blouse. \"You go first,\" Kirk said. \"And do as you\\'re told. You may be a Mythoxian, but this .# doesn\\'t know that. It puts big holes in anybody.\" As Naia walked serenely toward the hall door, there was only a touch of sullenness at the comers of her mouth. She turned her head to speak over her shoulder. \"Hiding \\' behind a t woman, brave Earthman?\" \"Yes and no. I\\'m hiding behind a woman from those damn straightleft rays, and Pm not a brave Earthman. I spend most of my time scared to death. That\\'s why all of us are getting back to Earth quick, so I can draw an easy breath,\"  \"All of us?\"  \"Oh yes. Didn\\'t I tell you? Yoii\\'re taking me to the places I can find Alma Dakin and Orin. We\\'re going to have witnesses and testimony. And the party who gets burned isn\\'t going to be Paul Cordell.\" \"I won\\'t -- \" \"Hold it, honey.\" Kirk had picked up two items upon leaving Naia\\'s apartment. A pair of filmy silk stockings and a white scarf. He jerked Naia\\'s hands behind her back in somewhat of a surprise move. Before she recovered, her wrists were tightly bound. She gasped, \"You -- madman,\" just before he deftly pulled the scarf across her mouth and twisted it into an effective gag. He stepped back to admire his handywork. \"Now we\\'re all ready. Orin and Alma.\" Naia shook her head in a slow\\' negative. Kirk pushed her gently into the hall and rounded to face her. \"Yes, baby,\" he said. \"You ought to know now I won\\'t be stopped. I need Orin to fly that space buggy. If I don\\'t get him we can\\'t go. Then there\\'d be nothing left for me to do but even the score for Paul Cordell. He\\'ll have to go but you\\'ll keep him company.\" Naia stood like \\' a statue, apparently considering. Then she moved slowly down the corridor in the opposite direction from which Kirk had come. Down three curving flights and stopping finally in front of a door identical to her own. L Kirk stepped forward and leaned firmly on the knob. The door opened. He knew where the bedroom was in these apartments now. He pushed Naia ahead of him, into the bedroom and saw Alma lying with her eyes dosed. Kirk whirled, just in time to level his gun and bring Orin to a dead stop. \"Over by the bed, high-born.\" As Orin complied, Kirk leered at Naia. \"That was clever, but I had it doped. I spotted them for husband and wife or the Mythox equivalent quite some time back. A good chance shot to hell.\" \"What do you want here?\" Orin demanded. \"A chauffeur. We\\'re heading Earthward on the first ship. That\\'s the one out in the jungle.\" \"But you talked to Tamu. I thought -- \" \"I\\'d been suckered? No no my friend ! On the force they called me the boy with the one-track mind.\" \"I can see what they meant,\" Orin sighed. \"I thought you would. Tell your wife to get dressed. We\\'re getting an airsled.\" \"You might have the decency to -- \" \"I won\\'t turn my back. You can stand between us. That\\'s the best I can do.\" A lma dressed swiftly in a costume similar to Naia\\'s. When they were ready to leave, Kirk said, \"Now let\\'s get it straight once and for all. I\\'ll stand for no fast moves. It\\'s Earth or some quick slugs. Do you follow me?\" Theydid not speak but they evidently believed Kirk because, fifteen minutes later, the party of four stood beside the ugly ship while thick trees and grasses whispered around them. \"Inside.\" In the corridor, Orin stopped and turned as though having thought of a convincing argument he was bent upon trying. Kirk poked him sharply in the ribs with the barrel of the .# and he moved on after the women toward the ladder and thence to the motor room. Once inside, Orin turned and spoke sharplv. \"Won\\'t you reconsider?\" \"Push the levers, jack. The right ones.\" \"Tamu is a reasonable man. We could talk to him again. He would make even a more generous offer.\" \"I\\'m waiting.\"  \"Certainly you did not refute the logic of his argument? We are in the right. Our case is just. The galaxies must be protected from -- \" \"The right levers, Jack.\" \" -- from those who through ignorance, stupidity,\\' or ferocity would destroy it.\" \"One more minute of .this and there\\'ll be dead people aboard this ship.\" \"You\\'re helpless, really. You can\\'t fly this ship without me. Therefore my life is safe. I merely refuse to launch it.\" \"Would you like a dead wife?\" Orin whitened perceptibly. \"She may be a wife to you, but to me she\\'s just a doll who helped lie a man into the chair.\" \"You wouldn\\'t do it! You haven\\'t got the nerve to shoot down a man or a woman in cold blood.\" Kirk looked steadily into Orin\\'s eyes. \"You don\\'t believe that do you, hud?\" Orin held the gaze for a long time. Then he dropped his eyes. \"No. I don\\'t believe it.\" \"Then get to work.\" \"One last offer. Won\\'t you reconsider. Join us?\" \"No!\" \"Very well.\" And Orin, a fixed, taut look on his face, reached forth his hand and touched a button on the panel board. It was a very special button. A button for use only when all hope was gone. The exploding space-time ship lighted the countryside to blinding    A.P.

What do you want to go to the moon for?\" \"Sure, why you wanna go? What they got on the moon we aint got right here?\" There was general laughter from the dozen or so who sat eating their lunch in the shade of Building B. They all thought that was a pretty good one. Good enough to repeat. \"Sure, what they got on the moon we ain\\'t got here?\" But Joe Spain wasn\\'t in the rnood for jokes. He burned with even greater conviction and stood up as though to harangue the workers. \"You wanta know why I got to go to the moon? Why I\\'ve got to get on that ship? Then PH tell you.

He\\'d expected to get by, but it was one of the calculated risks tiiat could have stopped him cold. Once inside the building, he put the bag into his locker and went to work. He labored briskly and carried more than his share of the load. But now again he stopped to look over at the outline of Building A, limned hard against hot blazing sky. And each time it was with a sense of heady exhilaration that he thought of his destiny -- his hard earned, dearly bought destiny. To be among that select group who would first set foot upon the surface of the Moon! He had no worries about not being allowed to do so. Once he showed himself -- with the ship far out in space -- they\\'d have to accept him. Not graciously of course, but they\\'d have to admire his courage and tenacity. They could not in all humanity, deny him a share of th victory. The day wore on and as quitting time approached, he became more tense -- more alert. Five minutes before the whistle, he faded back into the building and hurried to the lavatory. He went into the booth furthest from the entrance and locked the door. Now there was nothing to do but wait. Another of the calculated risks. The whistle blew. Almost immediately, the sound of footsteps broke the silence and the lavatory was filled with hurrying men. Their stay in the room was short, however, as Joe had known it would be. Men leaving for home do not dawA die on the premises. The lavatory was empty again. A period of silence while Joe raised his feet from the floor and braced them on the toilet seat. The entrance door opened. A guard making the departure checkup. Joe held his breath. If the guard came down the line and tried the door, he was finished. But Joe had banked upon human nature. The guard stopped. For a long .moment there was no sound and joe knew the man was bending over to run his eves down the line of toilets close to the floor. In this manner he could see the floor of every booth. The guard straightened, turned, walked out. The door closed. Silence. Joe\\'s heart swelled with gratitude. He grinned, looking forward with joy to the long night ahead. He found a spot over behind the barrels where the night watchman would have to climb over a lot of equipment in order to find him. He made himself comfortable, practically certain the guard would not do this. He stretched out on the hard floor and recorded the passing of the hours by the number of times the watchman went through. And he was surprised at how fast the time passed. Finally, checking his count carefully, he left his hiding place and tiptoed to the line of lockers. He took the oxygen equipment from the duffel bag after which he hid the bag and the clothing therein behind a wall flange in a far corner... Then he climbed into the barrel at the front end of the packing line. He checked the barrel with a small X and jockeyed the lid into place.  pened. He wondered if he\\'d missed on the time element. The men should certainly have come to work now. More than once he was fempted to push the barrel lid aside and checkthe situation. When footsteps sounded, close by, and the lid snapped firmly into place, he was glad he hadn\\'t done so. Good old Nick! When he got back from the Moon, he\\'d see to it that Nick got credit for his courageous act. Soon the barrel began to move. Joe felt it rise into the air and settle with a thump. Then the motor of a truck roared and Joe knew where he was going. Straight toward Building A and the Moon rocket. There was more movement until finally the barrel was set down for what appeared to be the last time, joe put the nose-piece of the oxygen tube into place and visualized himself safe and snug in a storage room of the rocket. He closed his eyes and went peacefully to sleep. He slept a long time, to be awakened by a crushing -- a wrenching -- that all but drove his head down into his spine. The pain brought him sharply alert. He knew instant\\' ly what had happened. Blast-off. He braced himself against the sides of the barrel and gritted his teeth.  Soon it was better. Then no pressure at all. Only the fierce happiness on his heart. He\\'d set a course and won through! He was on the way to the Moon! Joe let plenty of time elapse. He knew it was well over an hour later when he unlimbered the torch to cut an escape-hole in the barrel. This, he knew, would be tricky. He could easily burn himself. The heat would be intense. But it wasn\\'t too bad. The aluminum cut quickly and in a matter of minutes, he was standing beside his barrel. As he\\'d suspected, it was a storage hold. The pitch darkness did not bother him. He\\'d come prepared with a small pencil flash that threw an adequate beam. He found the door, opened it and went out into a long passageway... N OW HE\\'D covered the length and breadth of the ship. He\\'d found a lot of rooms -- all in pitchdarkness. No observation ports. And no living thing. He stood frozen in one of the rooms while the beam of his flash picked out a code stenciled n a steel plate over some piece of machinery. X#-#MY -- Experimental -- Explosion Rocket -- Moon. The flash dropped from Joe Spain\\'s fingers. He stood in the pitch darkness while the jets vibrated through the rocket. But there was no fear in him. Only the great pain of futility. Only his tears, and his whispered words: \"They\\'ll never know. Nobody won\\'t ever know!\" jua was neauty -- sne wa. Fascination -- she was Death  Klia had a beautiful why not?

And streets by night, watching the crowds with eyes of gray steel, waiting for Klia\\'s probing thoughts to touch some unwary Terrain Sooner or later she would t have to betray herself to him if she meant to pursue her goal. And then he would kill her and go. This was Ms task, set for him by the director of the Phoenician Quarantine Commission. He had been here six months, s far the only evidence of resence was a series of articles journal, written by Willa e author had access to in no information was prealmost humorspeculation it was ohio steer the certain were those of the paranoid, but having matured in a society where such patterns were the norm, she was neither insane nor neurotic. Her mind was keen, and her grfals were those of the predator... San Rorrck had tq find and kill her quickly. He watched the streets by night because her race and his were both non-sleepers. They were capable resting a part of the brain at a time having two cortical areas for bodily function. He knew she won become bored by ni tivity; sooner or later she come w city slept.

Of one thing he was certain : Her paranoid pride would not permit her to assume a guise regarded as ugly by this world. Most certainly she would make herself strikingly beautiful. San Rorrek however had reduced his body-weight, padded his cheekbones to give himself a gaunt appearance, dyed his hair black and his skin a sallow shade. An irritant, rubbed into pinpricks on his face, resulted in mild acne that made him something less than handsome. He smeared his teeth with brown stain, wore shabby second-hand clothing, and a pair of plain-rimmed glasses. He was not here to attract attention ; he was here to kill. He looked like a peddler or a laborer out of a job. He was walking down a sidestreet at midnight when he caught the first faint aura of her presence. She was somewhere within a few blocks, and she was planting a suggestion in the mind of the Terran who would not recognize the source of the thoughts as stemming from outside his own consciousness.  Sweee-whew! Thai dame on the corner! Did she look at me? Think Til walk that way. This was it! San had not reached out to touch the Terran # s mind, for in doing so he would broadcast his own thought-aura and reveal his presence to Klia. He had merely listened to Kfia\\'s planting of the thought in the Terran s mind, and he caught the general direction from whence it came. He began walking rapidly up the street, then cut through the blackness of an alley. Was she playing games, or had she chosen a Terran to be of some service to her? Perhaps she was bored, and only wanted a brief love-affair... paused to peer toward both intersections. There were a few people on the sidewalk, but no woman tail enough to be Klia. He jaywalked and darted down the next alleyway. If the Terran had responded immediately to her suggestion, they would perhaps be gone before he could reach them. But then he caught another brief flash of thought-not words, but an image. She was helping the Terran imagine what she might look like without clothing. San chuckled as he trotted ahead. Unknowingly, she had given him a clue as to her appearance. Through glandular control, she had apparently padded herself to a remarkable condition of mammalian grandiloquence. The effect was almost surrealistic; the way a male might design a female if he had any choice in the matter. \"You liked that, eh?\" snarlecl a quiet voice from the darkness of a doorway. He stopped abruptly  in mid, alley, caught in a puddle of moonlight. She had tricked him. There had been no Ter ran. The phoney suggestion had been a trap. He glanced quickly around. \"Don\\'t move,\" she snapped. \"I\\'ve got a native gun on. you -- a projectile weapon, in case you aren\\'t familiar with their artifacts.\" Fie stood in stony silence, staring at the doorway until he made out her faint shadow. There was a tiny venom-gun strapped to his wrist, but its action would not be immediate, and if he used it, she would have ample time to kill him before she died. If it came to that he would use it, but now he hesitated, trying to piece together her immediate intentions. He shrugged and grinned. \"Okay. So I lost. Shoot and get it over with.\" \"Not here. They\\'d run an autopsy on you, pastoral. They\\'d figure you weren\\'t quite Terran.\" \"Fm no pastoral. Pm an inventive.\" \"It\\'s all the same to me, Rorrek. You\\'re a lousy Thirder, Now move! Stay in the moonlight and walk slow. Stop when you come to the street. HI be right behind you.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"Shut up! And don\\'t start making suggestions at a policeman, or I\\'ll kill you.\" Rorrek started walking. He felt her thoughts scanning lightly through various regions of consciousness-patterns until she found a taxi-driver. Then: I gotta hunch there\\'s a customer on the next street . Think Til turn right. The taxi was approaching the alley entrance as they emerged. \"Flag it,\" she ordered. Rorrek obeyed grim-lipped. \"You get in first, darling,\" she said in a pleasant tone. \"I like to sit on the right\" \"That\\'s just because I\\'m right handed, dear,\" he purred acidly. \"Where to, sir?\" Out of the city , the girl ordered Rorrek wordlessly. Tell him . \"Ask her. She\\'s boss.\" The gun jabbed him ruthlessly in the ribs. The driver grinned. \"Where to, lady?\" She hesitated. \"A long trip?\" \"I low long?\" \"Oh, thirty, forty miles. North.\" \"It\\'ll cost you.\" \"That\\'s all right. Will twenty dollars do it?\" \"Maybe. Watch the meter and double it. You\\'ll have to pay both ways.\" \"Let\\'s go.\" Rorrek glanced at her sourly as they moved through the traffic. She had been exaggerating only slightly with the mental image used to trap him. The platinum blonde hair, the gray eyes, the aristocratic features, the full, slightly cynical mouth -- she conformed perfectly to the beauty standards of this world. The black dress revealed things that would have won her first place in any of the inane native female contests. \"You\\'ve done well by yourself, I see,\" he said, eyeing the expensive clothing and jewelry. What tele path couldn\\'t? And stop talking aloud . He watched her for a moment. The gun was in her handbag. So was her hand. And she was keeping a sharp eye on him. Rorrek frowned No opening yet. Where are we going? Someplace where you can dig a hole without being seen.  Rorrek stared ahead at the traffic for a moment. He didn\\'t need to ask her what the hole was for. ing an intersection and the light was just changing from green to red. Having heard the girl summon the taxi, Rorrek knew the man\\'s consciousness pattern. He adjusted to it quickly and planted a rapid suggestion: Damn the light ! I can make it! The girl cursed and lifted the handbag. The light was already red. A car shot out from the other street. The brakes screamed. A policewhistle shrilled angrily. \"Shoot,\" Rorrek dared, smirking at Klia. The handbag hesitated. \"Make a wrong move and I\\'ll have to.\" The driver was too busy with his own troubles to hear them. The cop came stalking across the pavement. \"You like to live dangerously, huh?\" he said in a bored voice. The cabby began a plaintive explanation. \"Come on, dear,\" said Klia. \"We\\'ll catch another cab \" \"I like this one,\"  Get out , or Fll kilt you and the cop too. Pay the driver. Rorrek handed the driver a dollar. They crossed to the sidewalk and the girl looked shaken. This was a busier street and there were  m more pedestrians. He grinned at her again. \"May I buy you a drink before you finish me off?\" Surprisingly, she replied, \"Fll let you live that long, pastoral. It\\'s interesting to watch you try to wiggle out of it.\" He knew she meant it. She could have hypnotized the cop and the driver, shot him in the cab, and strolled calmly away as one of a dozen multiple mental images. She could still do it, but evidently the idea of making him dig his own grave appealed to her icy sense of humor. They entered a small bar and she directed him toward a secluded booth. \"I\\'m surprised you haven\\'t used your wrist weapon yet,\" she said as they sipped a martini. \"Apparently you pastorals have no capability for self-sacrifice.\" His face showed no surprise, but he rested his arm across the table. He smirked. \"I was waiting for a better opportunity, but since you put it that way let\\'s get it over with.\" His other hand darted toward the lethal wrist. \"One moment,\" she said. He paused. \"Do you have an extra projectile?\" He frowned, then nodded. She smiled again, and laid a braceleted white arm across the table. \"I\\'ll skve you the trouble of firing. Prick me with it.\" His throat started with surprise. \"You\\'re not immune,\" he hissed. \"To Ayoyo venom? Try me.\" Rorrek gained new admiration for her.

An inventive is a maladjusted pastoral who wishes he were I a Klidd.\" Her use of the ancient feudal name for her race startled him. His people had almost forgotten it. Once on Nu Phoenicis IV there had been the Klidds, or barons, the Algum or serfs, and the Taknon, or artisans. The feudal system had lasted more than five thousand years, and because of natural selection operating within the occupational groups, the three classes had become genetically distinct. After the rise of a technology, the Klidds were overthrown and exiled to the ironless fourth planet where they formed their own ruthless social order under a strict space quarantine, enforced by the Taknon spaceforce which Rorrek served. ;uing heredity with he said. \" ss your t s go, .e signals.

Just stand there and keep your hands in sight.\" Rorrek kept his hands in sight. He stared at the cop, suggesting nausea, suggesting a fluttering of the heart, suggesting asphyxiation. The cop began to gasp and reel. Rorrek increased the mental dosage. The cop choked and fainted. As Rorrek walked calmly out into the night, he heard voices behind him telling that the girl was dead. He felt sick himself now. There was something compelling about Klia, something that attracted. He felt a little like a child,  drawn toward a cruel mother -- or Terra possessed the only human life in the galaxy. So he was stuck here for life unless a Taknon ship came to pick him up, and there had been no guarantee of that from the Commission. Secret landings on nonspacegoing planets were forbidden except in several specifically defined emergencies. Rescuing a second-class agent was not one of them. , He was faced with a life of ease but of loneliness. A telepath would have no difficulty acquiring tremendous wealth here, but a telepath would have no company -- unless he could find a few natives a husband, lured to a wantonly selfish and unfaithful mistress. He knew she had to be killed, yet now that it was done, he felt rotten inside. At last he found a doctor and had his flesh-wound dressed. Fie stared at the doctor peculiarly and the medic seemed to forget it had been a bullet wound. Rorrek went \\'i whose neural associative circuits were so ordered as to make telepathy latently possible. Occasionally he had encountered a Terran whose thought-aura was vaguely perceptible. Perhaps, through long and patient hypnotic conditioning, their latent abilities could be brought forth. If the genetic hodgepodge could be straightened out, Terran had high possibilities. Their\" basic genetic emotion-patterns were not as sharply divided into groups a those of Nu Phoenicis, but the patterns were present, and the conflict among them was present. Rather than calling them Pastorals, Inventives, and Imperials, as in the Phoenician case, he decided perhaps that the basic Terran-pattems could best be described by the goals they were inclined to favor. The \"Security-Seekers\", the \"Knowledge-Seekers\", and the \"GlorySeekers\" perhaps. Phoenician code forbade any tampering with non-threat cultural forms, but who was there to enforce it? And in a sense, this was his planet now. Marooned here, he could participate in a subtle way, and help a few local inventives find new directions. Maybe he owed who would certainly have steered them spaceward, although the end result would have been disastrous for them, had her plan worked. Francisco he spent replenishing his funds through poker games, wrestling matches, and various forms of betting in which thoughtprojective powers were a distinct advantage. Then he rented a house in the suburbs, ordered half a ton of various electronic parts, and began building several computer units while he concentrated on revising his physical appearance to a more pleasing form. As the weeks passed, he put on weight, removed the fatty tissue from his cheekbones, thickened his cheeks enough to remove the gauntness, and restored his complexion to a healthier hue. When he was finished, he had the appearance of a gregarious young businessman, cleanly attractive but not offensively handsome. He finished the computer shortly after he finished himself. It was not a large unit as computers went. It was built into a chassis the size of an eight-foot refrigerator. A Terran might say it was constructed to handle problems in that rarefied strata of mathematics known as the Von Neumann theory of games. But the twenty-four instruments on its face were calibrated in \"points per share\". Rorrek spent a month in libraries, photographing stock-market reports covering a thirty-year period. These he laboriously studied, plotting the rise and fall of each stock on graphs, writing empirical equations to describe each graph, and feeding the equations to the computer\\'s memory tanks. Fed also into the tanks, were thirty-year record-equations describing taxrates, population growth, national income, government expenditures, world armaments, exports, imports, and average individual incomes. The computer, required to assume that all the variables were dependent upon one another, evolved an implicit function in some thirtyseven variable quantities. He then fed it the \"present conditions\" and required it to extrapolate the values forward over a period of two months. Eleven stocks appeared due for sharp rises within the period. San Rorrek invested ten thousand dollars. At the end of two months, the stocks had risen fifteen thousand. He corrected the small errors in the computer\\'s estimates by supplying new data, then extrapolated again, selling and reinvesting in accordance with the new predictions. There was danger, of course, that a completely unpredictable series of events might occur to cause unfavorable market fluctuations. Therefore he very carefully watched world conditions, political developments, and technical advancements. Klia\\'s articles were still appearing in magazines and technical journals, but that was not surprising, considering the usual lag between the acceptance of an essay and its publication. And the pieces were having subtle repercussions in the news, attracting no attention in themselves, but spurring certain scientists to think along new lines. Klia had suggested a method for testing basic mental formative patterns in infancy; and now a western university\\'s psychology department was setting up a research lab \"for studying the basic affective reaction patterns of infants at birth\". Klia, under another pen-name, had suggested an extension of relativistic mechanics to cover hypothetical N-dimensional universes. The newspapers announced now that the famous mathematician, Larwich, was beginning work on the creation of a mathematical physics with no basic assumptions other than those of elementary arithmetic. \"Man\\'s only insight into reality,\" said Larwich, \"derives  from his ability to count on his fingers. All else is purely experiential approximation.\" Rorrek grinned. Klia had been \" trying to steer Terran inventors straight toward a fivespace interstellar drive, while the government  research in the hope of reaching the moon. She was trying to get the mathematicians to see the velocity of light as a constant only at one specific universe-level of five-space, and as a different constant at other levels. And she had managed to steer Larwich in the right direction. Only one thing was lacking: an experiential tie between observable reality and the theory Larwich would certainly develop. Without\\' it, the theory would remain merely abtruse mathematical speculation of an invariantive nature. Rorrek\\'s fingers itched at the typewriter, longing to supply the missing suggestion. A guilt-reaction, he told himself, probably associated with Klia\\'s death. Nevertheless he wrote an essay entitled \"Origin of Interstellar Hydrogen\", and sent it to a university press periodical. The article suggested that the spontaneous appearance of matter in the fourspace cosmos could be explained in terms of a five-space continuum with a circulation of matter along the fifth component. The essay was rejected with a brief note from the editor: \"Sorry, but we just last week purchased an essay dealing with the mechanics of this \\'continuous creation # notion. Your style is good. Try us again, .soon. Editor. # \\' Rorrek snorted and chucked the essay in the wastebasket. Some local yokel had probably beat him to the draw with some weirdly empirical notion that left out the tie with five-space. The rejection irritated him. He decided to give it up for a while, and concentrate on making himself Dr. Larwich was in San Francisco for the summer. After some debate about the desirability of direct intervention, he found the professor\\'s address -- a modest cottage overlooking the bay with a short stretch of narrow beach before it. half a mile away. Three days later he wandered I past the professor\\'s cottage, having spied three brown todies sunbathing on the beach before it. As he drew nearer, he studied them curiously. An elderly couple and a girl in her late twenties, possibly Larwich\\'s daughter. She was watching him casually -- a large, dark girl with hazel eyes and firm breasts. Rorrek approached \\'the group. \"Am I still on a public beach?\" he asked, \"Or am I a trespasser?\" The elderly couple glanced up questioningly. The girl smiled. \"Trespassers are welcome. Help yourself.\" She had a nice musical voice. \"I\\'ve got the next cottage down the line,\" he said. \"Bui I scarcely realized I had neighbors.\" \"It is lonely out here. Won\\'t you sit with us awhile? You look tired.\" Rorrek grinned and patted a slight bulge in his mid-section. \"Trying to work off my bay window.\" He strolled toward them, scraping his feet in the sand. The old man looked down at his own sagging belly, then glowered at the stranger. \"Young man, you have just committed a grievous faux pas, # \\' he grunted. \"I\\'m Edith Larwich,\" said tke girl. \"This is my father. Frank Larwich... and my mother, Louise.\" He nodded and sat down. \"I\\'m Sam Rory.\" He hesitated, looking at the professor and gathering a frown. \"Larwich -- Frank Larwich -- I\\'ve heard of you, I think. Is it Doctor Larwich -- of the new-look in invariantive viewpoints?\" The old man looked surprised. He lifted his eyebrows first at his wife, then his daughter. He extended his hand to Rorrek and looked a beam of amusement down his slender nose. \"Young man, you have just absolved yourself of that faux pas. What school are you with?\" \"No school.\" \"What research lab, then?\" \"No lab, I\\'m a gambler.\" \"Bah! Stop joking. Laymen don\\'t talk about invariance, or remember the names of old codgers like me.\" i He shrugged, \"I apologize for being a layman, sir, but I like mathematics. I\\'ve read a few of your pieces in the digest.\" Larwich glanced at his wife and daughter again. They were looking curiously at Rorrek. \"My fame comes as a distinct shock to me,\" the old man said tea n#  V mm a it?  n managed to rom her body, beauty were to appeal to him, o you expect to publish theory.

Any man would could work that theory out in a few months was certainly the mental equal of the best minds of his own race. It startled him. Here seemed proof enough that T erran-humanity was going places, given a little intelligent biosocial reform. \"That\\'s remarkable,\" he murmured,. \"I thought it would be at least two years,\" \"So did I. But Edith here helped me tremendously with certain down-to-earth suggestions.

When Harwich was through, physicists could build an experimental five-space generator on the basis of his theory. When the physicists were through making data-tables, engineers would be able to construct a working model interstellar drive, provided someone would make the investment.

Rorrek watched her plunging gracefully in the surf, and he wondered at his vague uneasiness.  \"What do you really do, Sam?\" Larwich asked. \"Investor. I hit it lucky on the market. Gambler -- same thing \" . Larwich chuckled. \"You evidently read technical publications as a hobby, then. Or are you working on a mathematical way to beat the stock market?\" Rorrek smiled enigmatically, and got to his feet. \"You might try the Von Neumann theory of games,\" he offered, then smiled sheepishly. \"If you\\'ll excuse me, I think I\\'ll join  your daughter for a swim.\" feeble breakers when he trotted through the shallow water, but she rolled on her back to wave \\' and watch him. A very beautiful, intelligent girl, he thought calculating! y. If he were to remain marooned on Terra, it would be interesting to see if normal procreation could result from marriage with a native. He felt an urge to touch the girl\\'s mind, then decided against it for the present. Some Terr an s seemed sensitively receptive, and they became startled by undue power. She lay treading water until he swam up beside her, then she smiled but her eyes were thoughtful. \"Water\\'s nice!\" he grunted. \"Is it?\" He frowned. \"Why the challen ing tone ?\" Who are you, anyway?\" Just who I said I was.

Was she angling? \"Just fine \" he said. \"Why don\\'t you come down?\" She lifted her wet head from the tide and nodded soberly. \"I will. Very soon.\" Again he felt the vague uneasiness. Rorrek spent the afternoon on his porch, watching the bay. Tomorrow he meant to go back to the suburbs, return to the task of making hirnself the wealthiest man in the country as quickly as possible, then start endowing universities with research grants like a fat old capitalist with a guilty conscience. Twilight came, and he felt the loneliness of an alien longing for home. He visualized the warm, rollwith pastoral Algun villages, and the great walled city-states of the Taknon, covering hundreds of square miles and set in the midst of the Algun landscape. They worked in harmony, the two races -- each maintaining its own government, each keeping itself socially and biologically separated, yet each realizing that one could not exist and prosper without the other. It was a class society that worked, worked because the classes were divided according to the goals they sought, not according to any artificial framework. Of course, Man\\'s goals were chosen in the light of his emotions and aptitudes, and at least among the Phoenicians, emotion and aptitude patterns were founded on genetic bed-rock. It was only rarely that Taknon aptitudes were bom in an Algun village, and equally rare when a pastorally inclined child appeared in the Taknon cities. Loneliness weighed heavily on him. With some misgivings he closed his eyes, and searched through the transor regions for the Larwich girl\\'s pattern of consciousness. When he passed through it, he started up with a low gasp -- and lost the pattern. There had been a knife-edge sharpness about it -- a clarity of focus that suggested resonant neural circuits as in the trained telepath. He groped for it again. But when he found it, the sharpness was gone -- if it had really been there. The transor was strong but blurred, unreadable. He decided his first impression had been illusion. I wonder what that young man is doing ? he suggested. He did invite me to his beach. Maybe if I walked down that way . He paused a moment, trying to catch the blurred images that swam in leisure through her consciousness. But they were too muddled. He withdrew from her and waited. Half-a-mile might be too far for the untrained mind to catch the faint suggestion, and even though she would mistake the thoughts for her own, she might offer herself some counter-excuse for not coming. the failing gray of twilight. After a few minutes, the screen door opened, and someone stood on the porch. Then she trotted down the steps to the beach and came walking his way, but looking toward the sea. As she drew nearer; he saw that she was wearing white shorts and a pale blue blouse with the tail knotted about her waist. The wind whipped the blouse against her breasts and ruffled her short dark hair like a nest of feathers. He watched her come toward him with narrow speculative eyes, and he wondered again: Was a procreative union possible here? She looked toward him and waved, breaking his reverie, then on apparently sudden impulse turned and plodded through the sand toward his porch. \"Am I trespassing? Or did you invite me to your beach?\" \"Come on up,\" he called. \"I was just wishing you\\'d drop by.\" She hooked her foot on the step and cocked her head at him. \"Why?\" It startled him. \"The answer to that,\" he chuckled, \"might be  found in textbooks of psychology and biology, particularly the latter. Come up and sit down.\" \"Not if you\\'re going to be biological #  \"Only in t respectively so. I have insufficient data on the subject to feel safe in rash experiments.\" She laughed aid came up to take a chair, propping her long, trim legs on the rail. \"The subject is a carnivore who might chew off an ear. #  \"Mrnmp! How about a nice thick steak with onions and french fries and a gallon of beer?\" \"The bloated subject would fall asleep in her cage\" \"Exactly. # She watched him with cool amusement in the dusk. \"I think we find each other attractive.\" \"Tm glad it\\'s mutual. I have plans for you. #  She dropped her legs, rested her elbows on her knees, and swung half around to grin peculiarly, head cocked up at him. \"Okay, Sam. Finish the funny story.\\' He leaned toward her and tried to steal as softly as possible into her consciousness pattern, but he kept his voice light and casual. \"The plan is simple biology, but it involves many unknowns as yet For instance -- \" He pulled her face toward him slowly, and moulded her mouth with his. Quietly they slipped to their feet, locked tightly together, laughing quietly with soft fire where their faces touched. He brought his mind slowly into full resonance with her pattern, demanding her to respond. The response was white flame, but not of the body. His mind reeled for an instant before he understood. Full focus ! Too bright! And something hard against Ms ribs. You should have been born a Klidd! He backed away, staring at her, and the glint of metal in her hand. I wasn\\'t certain , she went on until you threw that full resonance at me. \"Klia!\" \"Yes.\" She found a cigaret with her left hand and lit it while she held the gun on him with her right. He could see her face in the match-flare, and it appeared tight and drawn. \"Your lipstick is smeared,\" he offered. \"Thanks. It was a pleasure. Fm really sorry I have to kill you \" \"Like you killed Larwich\\'s blind daughter and took her place?\" Klia snorted. \"Shes not dead. She\\'s still blind, and she\\'s an amnesiac in a Pennsylvania psychopathic ward.\" \"Hypnotically induced amnesia, undoubtedly. # \"Right. I had to get her personality patterns, and leave her a blank\" \"I thought I left you dead on the floor.\" She sighed impatiently. \"Would a Terran know when a Phoenician was dead?\" Rorrek saw his blunder and\\' gritted his teeth. He\\'d been a fool to believe. Naturally, every time someone touched her wrist to test her pulse, she had simply stopped her heartbeat until the fellow let go, or perhaps shut off the circulation in the arm. \"Well, you\\'ve got Larwich well on the road to the theory of a space drive, I see.\" She nodded, started to reply, paused, then: \"You didn\\'t suspect me because you thought I was dead. Then why did you come prowling around Larwich?\" \"To do what you\\'ve already done.\" \"You\\'re lying.\" \"See for yourself,\" He began sliding into resonance with her, but she bached away warily and blocked him out. \"You can break it whenever you want to,\" he said. She risked it, and their transors found sharp focus again. He reeled off the contents of his associative circuits relating to Larwich and his theory, reeled them off too rapidly for them to be inventions of the moment. Then he switched to memories concerning his thoughts of her. \"Why did you do that?\" she muttered when he was through. Her voice was shaky, and the gun seemed to be sagging in her hand. He shrugged. \"We\\'re a long way from Nu Phoenicis. I expect to be here for good.\" \"You will be,\" she said ominously, straightening. \"Start marching down to the water.\" \"Why?\" \"The tide\\'s going out. You\\'ll go with it \" \"Suppose I suggest we work together,\" She laughed scornfully. \"Move, quickly, Taknon!\" He walked slowly down the steps and into the faint moonlight. He moved ahead with a calm leisurely tread. Behind him the girl laughed. \"You\\'re part Klidd, Rorrek. A hybrid -- or a throwback.\" He failed to ask her why. \"I could feel affection for a Taknon, but I couldn\\'t love one. Fve watched you. You\\'re part Klidd. I can feel it.\" He wondered why his throat constricted. He said nothing. \"I love you, Rorrek. Damn your hide.\" But she loved her planet more. \"What are you going to do about Larwich now?\" he asked coldly. \"Are you going to switch to someone else, or are you going to keep on brazening it out?\" \"Switch. I\\'m through with him. He\\'s on the right course,\" Rorrek started wading into shallow water. \"Go on out past the breakers,\" she called. \"I don\\'t want you to wash back in.\" \"Glad to oblige,\" he grunted, but he paused to look back. She had kicked off her sandals and was wading after him. She stopped, gun glinting in the moonlight. \"Well?\" \"\\'One thing.\" He scanned for her mind, but she blocked, refusing him resonance. He bludgeoned through until he made a strong but fuzzy contact. He held the contact, but turned away and began wading through the gentle rush of breakers while he wandered through his associative circuits concerning Stop it, Rorrek! I Then the resonance was complete., and he chuckled, because she was going to feel it when she shot him. Beyond the breakers, he turned again to fac her. She was reeling dizzily, holding the gun at arm\\'s length, with her left hand pressed tight to her face. shots when they came. Two went wide, but the third seared his chest, and he went down, fighting for air. hearing a choking scream from Kiia. He gasped once and went under, swimming weakly for deeper water. Another bullet streaked phosphorescence through the blackness about him. He drove still deeper, clinging precariously to consciousness. Another slug streaked under him ard he veered upward. Seven cartridges in the gun, five gone. If he could only live a little longer. Then he had to rise for air. He spun around and came up slowly, facing shore. She was walking dejectedly back across the beach toward his cottage. He waited for her to look back. He dog-paddled with the waves, but the tide seemed to be sweeping him out. \"PraTaW Bladen, Klia! # he choked in their native tongue. \"For the love of Man!\" She heard him. She turned slowly, watched him coldly for a moment, pistol lifted high. \" PraTalf Kliddn, TaknonV # came her icy paraphrase. The gun barked, and barked again. Seven! But this time it was his abdomen, and he heard himself screaming as he fought toward shore. He could only partially control the flow of blood to the wounds. When tissue cried for blood, the unconscious reflex let it go. It was like holding one\\'s breath, and occasionally he had to bleed. She was standing there watching him, white in the moonlight, locked in a kind of trance. Co, he thought at her savagely. When I get there , Vll kill you -- for those last two shots. She looked at the gun in her hand. She let it drop, stared down at it, wiped the hand distastefully on her shorts. She backed away a step, stumbled in the sand, and sat down, rolling her head on her knees. He groped for her mind, and she erected no block. She hoped he would die before he got to shore, but she wasn\\'t going to move. Fate, about to be satisfied -- it gave him angry strength. A breaker washed over him from behind, and he rode with it briefly. When it passed him by and dropped him, he stood chest-deep, wading shoreward. He peered at her dazedly, hands clenching and unclenching in anticipation. He let her feel the strength of his hate, but her thoughts were wandering -- her home, her people. But she saw them differently somehow, as if she were no longer capable of being guided by their values. Her affective framework had collapsed. She sat in a bewildered daze. He staggered from the water and fell to his knees on the sand. He crawled toward her with savage deliberation in the moonlight going to  a i v t him brittle shattered. She screamed and pawed at her face. He hit her again and again, rblling across the sand, battering her face until his fists were driving into wet pulp. \"My eyes! My eyes!\" Weakly he crouched over her, staring. She had been wearing contact lenses. The green irises had been stained on the glass to cover her gray ones. Now jagged slivers of glass protruded from under her eyelids. She rolled her head and moaned, trying to escape him. :s were coming down the beach, and Doc. Larwich was shouting frantically.

When he awoke, he expected to iron bars, or the walls of a hospital room. Instead, he was in his own home in the suburbs. He tried move, and groaned. Something rustled in the room, \"Lie still  # she said. He rolled his head weakly to look at her. She sat stiffly in a straightbacked chair by the window, morning sunlight playing in her hair. There was a bandage across her eyes. He groped for her mind, and found the answer.

He liked the way it slapped back against his shoulder when he fired. Somehow it did not seem a part of the dank, steaming Venusian jungle.

Look, there\\'s something!\" Judd followed her pointing finger with his eyes. Half-hidden by the creepers and vines clinging to an old \\' tree-stump, something was watching them. It wasn\\'t very big and it seemed in no hurry to get away. \"What is it?\" Lindy wanted to know. \"Don\\'t know. Never saw anything like it before. Venus is still an unknown frontier; the books only name a couple dozen of the biggest animals. But hell, Lindy, that\\'s not game. I don\\'t think it weighs five pounds.\" \"It\\'s cute, and it has a lovely skin.\" Judd couldn\\'t argue with that. Squatting on its haunches, the creature was about twenty inches tall. It had a pointed snout and two thin, long ears. Its eyes were very big and very round and quite black. They looked something like the eyes of an Earth! an tarsier, hut the tarsier were bloody little beasts. The skin was short and stiff and was a ft kind of silvery white. Under the sheen, however, it seemed to glow. A diamond is colorless, Judd thought, but \"when you see it under light a whole rainbow of colors sparkle deep within it. This creature\\'s skin was like that, Judd decided. \"If we could get enough of them,\" Lindy was saving, \"Fd have the most unusual coat! Do you think we could find enough, Judd?\" \"I doubt it. Never saw anything like it before, never heard of anything like it. You\\'d need fifty of \\'em, anyway. Let\\'s forget about it -- too small to shoot, anyway.\" \"No, Judd. I want it.\" \"Well, I\\'m not going to stalk a five-pound -- hey, wait a minute! I taught you how to use this rifle, so why don\\'t you bag it?\" Lindy grinned. \"That\\'s a fine idea. I was a little scared of some of those big lizards and cats and everything, but now I\\'m going to take you up on it. Here, give me your gun.\" Judd removed the leather thong from his shoulder and handed the weapon to her. She looked at it a little uncertainly, then took the clip of shells which Judd offered and slammed it into the chamber. The little creature sat unmoving. \"Isn\\'t it peculiar that it doesn\\'t run away, Judd?\" \"Sure is. Nothing formidable about that animal, so unless it has a hidden poison somewhere, just about anything in this swamp could do it in. To survive it would have to be fast as hell and it would have to keep running all the time. Beats me, Lindy \" \"Well, Tm going to get myself one pelt toward that coat, anyway. Watch, Judd: is this the way?\" She lifted the rifle to her shoulder and squinted down the sights toward the shining creature. \"Yeah, that\\'s the way. Only relax. Relax. Shoulder\\'s so tense you\\'re liable to dislocate it with the kick. There -- that\\'s better.\" Now Lindy\\'s finger was wrapped around the trigger and she remembered Judd had told her to squeeze it, not to pull it. If you pulled the trigger you jerked the rifle and spoiled your aim. You had to squeeze it slowly... The animal seemed politely interested. Suddenly, a delicious languor stole over Lindy. It possessed her all at once and she had no idea where it came from. Her legs had been stiff and tired from the allmorning trek through the swamp, but now they felt fine. Her whole body was suffused in a warm, satisfied glow of well-being. And laziness. It was an utterly new sensation and she could even feel it tingling even at the roots of her hair. She sighed and lowered the rifle. \"I don\\'t want to shoot it,\" she said. \"You just told me you did.\" \"I know, but I changed my mind. What\\'s the matter, can\\'t I change my mind?\" \"Of course you can change your mind. But I thought you wanted a coat of those things.\" \"Yes, I suppose I do. But I don\\'t want to shoot it, that\\'s all,\" Judd snorted. \"I think you have a streak of softness someplace in that pretty head of yours!\" \"Maybe. I don\\'t know. But I\\'d still like the pelt. Funny, isn\\'t it?\" \"Okay, okay! But don\\'t ask to use the gun again.\" Judd snatched it from her hands. \"If you don\\'t want to shoot it, then I will we can make you a pair of or something from the pelt.\" And Judd pointed his ancient rifles at the little animal preparing to snap off a quick shot. It would be a cinch at this distance. Even Lindy wouldn\\'t have missed, if she hadn\\'t changed her mind. Judd yawned. He\\'d failed to realize he was so tired. Not an aching kind of tiredness, but the kind that makes you feel good all over. He yawned again and lowered the rifle. \"Changed my mind,\" he said. \"I don\\'t want to shoot it, either. What say we head back for camp?\" Lindy gripped his hand impulsively. \"All right, Judd -- but I had a brainstorm! I want it for a pet!\" \"A pet?\" \"Yes. I think it would be the cutest thing. Everyone would look and wonder and I\\'ll adore it!\" \"We don\\'t know anythin! it. Maybe Earth would be too cold, or too dry, or maybe we don\\'t have anything it can eat. There are liable to be a hundred different strains of bacteria that can kill it.\" \"I said I want it for a pet. See? Look at it! We can call it tc Eyes\" Black Eyes -- \" Judd groaned. Yes, Black Eyes. If you don\\'t do this one thing for me, Judd -- \" , ut I\\'m not to do any tiling. You want it, you take it.\" Lindy frowned, looked at him crossly, then sloshed across the swamp toward Black Eyes. The creature waited on its stump until she came quite close, and then, with a playful little bound, it hopped onto her shoulder, still squatting on its haunches. Lindy squealed excitedly and began to stroke its silvery fur. to Earth, Judd and Lindy and Black Eyes. The hunting trip had been a success -- Judd\\'s trophies were on their way home on a slow\\' freighter, and he\\'d have some hne heads and skins for his study-room. Even Black Eyes had been no trouble at all. It ate scraps from their table, forever sitting on its haunches and staring at them with its big black eyes. Judd thought it would make one helluva lousy pet, but he didn\\'t tell Lindy. Trouble was, it never did anything. It merely sat still, or occasionally it would bounce down to the floor and mince along on its hind-legs for a scrap of food. It never uttered a sound. It did not frolic and it did not gambol. Most of the time it could have been carved from stone. But Lindy was happy and Judd said nothing. They had a little trouble with the customs officials. This because nothing unknown could be brought to Earth without a thorough examination. At the customs office, a bespectacled official stared at Black Eyes, scratching his head. \"Never seen one like that before\\' \"Neither have I,\" Judd admitted. \"Well, I\\'ll look in the book.\" The man did, but there are no thorough tomes on Venusian fauna. \"Not here.\" \"I could have told you.\" \"Well, we\\'ll have to quarantine it and study it. That means .you and your wife go into quarantine, too. It could have something that\\'s catching.\" \"Absurd!\" Lindy cried. \"Sorry, lady. I only work here.\" \"You and your bright ideas,\" Judd told his wife acidly. \"We may be quarantined a month until they satisfy themselves about Black Eyes.\" The customs official shrugged Ms bony shoulders; and Judd removed a twenty credit note from his pocket and handed it to the man. \"Will this change your mind?\" \"I should say not! You can\\'t bribe me, Mr. Whitney! You can\\'t -- \" The man yawned, stretched languidly, smiled. \"No sir, you can keep your money, Mr. Whitney. Guess we don\\'t have to examine your pet after all. Mighty cute little feller. Well, have fun with it. Come on, move along now.\" And, as they were departing with Black Eyes, still not believing their ears: \"Darn this weather! Makes a man so lazy... It was after the affair at the customs office, that Black Eyes uttered its first sound. City life hasn\\'t changed much in the last fifty years. Jet-cars still streak around the circumferential highways, their whistles blaring. Factories still belch smoke and steam, although the new s atomic power plants have lessened that to a certain extent. Crowds still throng the streets, noisy, hurrying, ill-mannered. Ids one of those things that can\\'t be helped, A city has to live, and it has to make noise. But it seemed to frighten Lindy\\'s new pet. It stared through the jetcar window on the way from the spaceport to the Whitney\\'s suburban home, its black eyes welling with tears. \"Look!\" Judd exclaimed. \"Black Eyes can cry!\" \"A crying pet, Judd. I knew there would be something unusual about Black Eyes, I just knew it!\" The tears in the big black eyes overflowed and tumbled out, rolling down Black Eyes\\' silvery cheeks. And then Black Eyes whimpered. It was only a brief whimper, but both Judd and Lindy heard it, and even the driver turned around for a moment and stared at the animal. The driver stopped the jet. He yawned and rested his head comfortably on the cushioned seat. He went quietly to sleep. owned the Merrywinkle Shipping Service. That, in itself, was not unusual. But at precisely the moment that Black Eyes unleashed its mild whimper, Mr. Merrywinkle -- uptown and five miles away -- called an emergency conference of the board of directors and declared: \"Gentlemen, we have all been working too hard, and I, for one, am going to take a vacation. I don\\'t know when I\\'ll be back, but it  won\\'t be before six months;\" \"But someone protested. \"There\\'s the Parker deal and the Gilette contract and a dozen other things. You\\'re needed!\" Mr. Merrywinkle shook his bald head. \"What\\'s more, you\\'re all taking vacations, with pay. Six months, each of you. We\\'re closing down Merrywinkle Shipping for half a year. Give the competition a break, eh?\" \"But C.M.! We\\'re about ready to squeeze out Chambers Parcel Co.! They\\'ll get back on their feet in six months.\" \"Never mind. Notify all departments of the shut-down, effective immediately. Vacations for all.\\' # belt?\" the foreman asked mildly. He was not a mild man and he usually stormed and ranted at the slightest provocation. This was at Clewson Jctcraft, and you couldn\\'t produce a single jet-plane without the assembly belt, naturally. A plump little man said, \"I did.\" \"But why?\" the foreman asked him, smiling blandly. \"I don\\'t know. I just did.\" The foreman was still smiling. \"I don\\'t blame you.\" Two days later, Clewson Jetcraft had to lay off all its help. They put ads in all the papers seeking new personnel but no one showed up. Clewson was forced to shut down. York pneumo-tube commuter\\'s special pulled to a bone-jarring stop immediately outside the New York station. Some angry commuters pried open the conductor\\'s cab, and found the man snoozing quite contentedly. They awakened him, but he refused to drive the train any further. All the commuters had to leave the pneumotrain and edge their way along three miles of catwalk to the station, No one was very happy about it,but the feeling of well-being which came over them all nipped any possible protest in the bud. when Judd and Lindy reached home but after that it was quiet. It just sat on its haunches near the window and stared out at the city. The quiet city. Nothing moved in the streets. Nothing stirred. People remained at home watching local video or the new space-video from Mars. At first it was a good joke, and the newspapers could have had a field day with it, had the newspapers remained in circulation. After four days, however, they suspended publication. On the fifth day, there was a shortage of food in the city, great stores of it spoiling in the warehouses. Heat and light failed after a week, and the fire department ignored all alarms a day later. But everything did not stop. School teachers still taught their classes; clerks still sold whatever goods were left on local shelves. Librarians were still at their desks. Conservatives said it was a liberal plot to undermine capital and demand higher wages; liberals said big business could afford the temporary layoff and wanted to squeeze out the small businessman and labor unions. Scientists pondered and city officials made speeches over video. \"Something,\" one of them observed, \"has hit our city. Work that requires anything above a modicum of sound has become impossible; in regards to such work people have become lazy. No one can offer any valid suggestions concerning the malady. It merely exists. However, if a stop is not put to it -- and soon -- our fair city will disintegrate. Something is making us lazy, and that laziness can spell doom, being a compulsive lack of desire to create any noise or disturbance. If anyone believes he has the solution, he  should contact the Department of Science at once. If you can\\'t use the video-phone, come in person. But come! Every hour which passes adds to the city\\'s woes.\" \\' Nothing but scatter-brained ideas for a week, none of them worth consideration. Then the bespectacled custom\\'s official who had bypassed quarantine for Black Eyes, got in touch with the authorities. He had always been a conscientious man -- except for that one lapse. Maybe the queer little beast had nothing to do with this crisis. But then again, the custom\\'s official had never before -- or since -- had... that strange feeling of lassitude. Could there be some connection? A staff of experts on extra-terrestrial fauna was dispatched to the Whitney residence, although, indeed, the chairman of the Department of Science secretly considered the whole idea ridiculous. The staff of experts introduced themselves. Then, ignoring the protests of Lindy, went to work on Black Eyes. At first Judd thought the animal would object, but apparently it did not. While conditions all about\\' them in the city worsened, the experts spent three days studying Black Eyes. They found nothing out of the ordinary. Black Eyes merely stared back at them, and but for an accident, they would have departed without a lead. On the third day, a huge mongrel dog which belonged to the Whitney\\'s next-door neighbors somehow slipped its leash. It was a fierce and ugly animal, and it was known to attack anything smaller than itself. It jumped the fence and landed in Judd Whitney\\'s yard. A few loping bounds took it through an open window, ground level. Inside, it spied Black Eyes and made for the creature at once, howling furiously. Black Eyes didn\\'t budge. And the mongrel changed its mind! The slavering tongue withdrew inside the chops, the howling stopped. The mongrel lay down on the floor and whined. Presently it lost all interest, got to its feet, and left as it had come. Other animals were brought to the Whitney home. Cats. Dogs. A lion from the city zoo, starved for two days and brought in a special mobile cage by its keeper. Black Eyes was thrust into the cage and the lion gave forth with a hideous yowling. Soon it stopped, rolled over, and slept. their reports, returned with them to the Whitney house. The leader, whose name was Jamison, said: \"As closely as we can tell, Black Eyes is the culprit.\" \"What?\" Lindy demanded. \"Yes, Mrs. Whitney. Your pet, Black Eyes.\" \"Oh, I don\\'t believe it!\" But Judd said, \"Go ahead, Dr. Jamison. I\\'m listening.\" \"Well, how does an animal -- any animal -- protect itself?\" \"Why, in any number of ways. If it has claws or a strong jaw and long teeth, it can fight. If it is fleet of foot, it can run. If it is big and has a tough hide, most other animals can\\'t hurt it anyway. Ummmm, doesn\\'t that about cover it?\" \"You left out protective coloration, defensive odors, and things like that. Actually, those are most important from our point of view, for Black Eyes\\' ability is a furtherramification of that sort of thing. Your pet is not fast. It isn\\'t strong. It can\\'t change color and it has no offensive odor to chase off predatory enemies. It has no armor. In short, can you think of a more helpless creature to put down in those Venusian swamps?\" After Judd had shaken his head, Dr. Jamison continued: \"Very well, Black Eyes should not be able to survive on Venus -- and I yet, obviously the creature did. We can assume there are more of the breed, too. Anyway, Black Eyes survives. And I\\'ll tell you why. \"Black Eyes has a very uncommon ability to sense danger when it approaches. And sensing danger,  I Black Eyes can thwart it. Your creature sends out certain emanations -- I won\\'t pretend to know what they are -- which stamp aggression out of any predatorycreatures. Neither of you could fire upon it -- right?\" \"Urnm-mm, that\\'s true Judd said. Lindy nodded. \"Well, that\\'s one half of it. There\\'s so much about life we don\\'t understand. Black Eyes uses energy of an unknown intensity, and the result maintains Black Eyes\\' life. Nov, although that is the case, your animal did not live a comfortable life in the Venusian swamp. Because no animal would attack it, it could not be harmed. Still, from what you tell me about that swamp... i \\'\"Anyhow. Black Eyes was glad to come away with you, and everything went well until you landed in New York. The noises, the clattering, the continual bustle of a great city -- all this frightened the creature. It was being attacked -- or, at least that\\'s what it must have figured. Result: it struck back the only way it knew how. Have you ever heard about sub-sonic soundwaves, Mr. Whitney, waves of sound so low that our ears cannot pick them up -- waves of sound which can nevertheless stir our emotions? Such things exist, and, as a working hypothesis, I would say Black Eyes\\' strange powers rest along those lines. The whole city is idle because Black Eyes is afraid!\" In his exploration of Mars, of Venus, of the Jovian Moons -- Judd Whitney had seen enough of extraterrestrial life to know that virtually anything was possible, and Black Eyes would be no exception to that rule. \"What do you propose to do?\" Judd demanded. \"Do? Why, we\\'ll have to kill your creature, naturallv. You can set a   value on it and we will meet it, but Black Eyes must die.\" \"No!\" Lindy cried. \"You can\\'t be sure, you\\'re only guessing, and it isn\\'t fair!\" \"My dear woman, don\\'t you realize this is a serious situation? The city\\'s people will starve in time, No one can even bring food in because the trucks make too much noise! As an alternative, we could evacuate, but is your pet more valuable than the life of a great city?\" itJsJ #  In no... \"Then, please! Listen to reason!\" \"Kill it,\" Judd said. \"Go ahead.\" Dr. Jamison withdrew from his pocket a small blasting pistol used by the Department of Domestic Animals for elimination of injured creatures. He advanced on Black Eyes, who sat on its haunches in the center of the room, surveying the scientist. \\' :  : Dr. Jamison put his blaster away. \"I can\\'t\\' he said. \"I don\\'t want to.\" Judd smiled. \"I know it. No one -- no thing -- can kill Black Eyes. You said so yourself. It was a waste of time to try it. In that case -- --\" \"In that case\\' Dr. Jamison finished for him, \"we\\'re helpless. There isn\\'t a man -- or an animalon Earth that will destroy this I thing. Wait a minute -- does it sleep, Mr. Whitney?\" \"I don\\'t think so. At least, I never saw it sleep. And your team of scientists, did they report anything?\" \"No. As far as they could see, the creature never slept. We can\\'t catch it unawares.\" \"Could you anesthetize it?\" \"How? It can sense danger, and long before you could do that, it would stop you. It\\'s only made one mistake, Mr. Whitney: it believes the noises of the city represent a danger. And that\\'s only a negative mistake. Noise won\\'t hurt Black Eyes, of course. It simply makes the animal unnecessarily cautious. But we cannot anesthetize it any more than we can kill it;\" \"I could take it back to Venus.\" \"Could you? Could you? I hadnH thought of that.\" Judd shook his head. \"I can\\'t.\" \"What do you mean you can\\'t?\" \"It won\\'t let me. Somehow it can sense our thoughts when we think something it doesn\\'t want. I can\\'t take it to Venus! No man could, because it doesn\\'t want to go.\" \"My dear Mr. Whitney -- do you mean to say you believe it can think r \"Uh-uh. Didn\\'t say that. It can sense our thoughts, and that\\'s something else again.\" Dr. Jamison threw his hands up over his head in a dramatic gesture. \"It\\'s hopeless.\" he said. York crawled along to a standstill People began to move from the city. In trickles, at first, but the trickles became torrents, as New depart for saner places. It might take months -- it\" might even take years, but the exodus had begun. Nothing could stop it. Because of a harmless little beast with the eyes of a tarsier. the life of a great city was coming to an end. Word spread. Scientists all over the world studied reports on Black Eyes. No one had any ideas. Everyone was stumped. Black Eyes had no particular desire to go outside. Black Eyes merely remained in the Whitney house, contemplating nothing in particular, and stopping everything. Dr. Jamison, however, was a persistent man. Judd got a letter from him one day, and the following afternoon he kept his appointment with the scientist \"It\\'s good to get out,\" Judd said, after a three hour walk to the Department of Science Building. \"I can go crazy just staring at that thing.\" i \"I have it, Whitney.\" \"You have what? Not the way to destroy Black Eyes? I don\\'t believe it!\" \"It\\'s true. Consider.

Just a few years and the beast would die, and... Dr. Jamison\\'s arguments were so logical that he convinced himself. He took Black Eyes with him into the Canadian North woods, and there they live.

Knowing the grand old man as I did, I can. say that he never intended his \"blessing\" should be-\\' come the curse to mankind that it did. And the catastrophe it brought about was certainly beyond range of all prophecy. Of course, anyone who lived in and tried to get inside StegTier\\'s weird lifecircle must agree can get too much of a mod thing. Even a pumpkin can and that\\'s what hap s Prof turned on his : and too :ot day Stegner an- of ten year\\'s  research on his selector. Nearly everyone present had read the sensational articles concerning his work in the feature sections of the big town newspapers. Like the rest, I had a vague idea of what it was about. It seemed the Prof had developed a device that repelled various particles of matter without effecting others. In short, if he turned on his gadget, gravity reversed itself for certain elements, and they went away in a hurry. Like this: he could take oxide of iron, turn on his selective repe and the rust rather mai to pure iron cimty.

Then he set about to try his selective repellor on living tissues. His suspicion, that wonderful things could be discovered if he tuned his anti \"gravitational field to the undesirable elements in the body, was confirmed. Like lead poisoning -- something no doctor cancure if it is severe. He found that he could cure a case of lead poisoning merely by making the lead go away from there via the field. More wonderful things began to come out of the Stegner laboratory, and he made a lot more iry.  Which was all very well indeed, couldn\\'t leave well enough alone -- he had to delve and Ms own theories about its cause, old age, and nuttier than a fruit cake. of a crank on bods and diets that with chemical organic garno was ever isoi    puzzle of all time me, no medical man cause of old age. I what the deterioration factor and I have provided a reme sure and immediate remedy! The golden age of mankind is here ! Our life span can be greatly extended!\" I looked at Jake Heinz, my cameraman. Jake winked at me, but i didn\\'t respond. I liked the Prof. Such a fine old gentleman, to go whacky from so much success Jake took a few shots of the Profs rabbits and guinea pigs, of the Prof himself, and of the apparatus he had constructed which he claimed drove out the causative poison of age; a poison he called a radioactive isotope of Potassium The other reporters, not bavin soft hearts Jake and I toted aroun wrote him up as a joke; sal out they thought the blowing his top. Immortality They presented the a farce. No reporters were wrong than those s Profs little over and y started. What kind of things? Well, up to that line, things were normal ; but beyond it, grass got enormous, the ground was higher and softer. Trees forgot to shed their leaves. Animals flocked there to eat the lush grass, so the Prof erected a ten-foot electrified fence around his land to keep out the hordes of rabbits, deer, mice and what have you that came to feast off the new supply of better forage. That was only the beginning. Some months later there came items about houseflies the size of walnuts hatching out around the Profs retreat. Now a swarm of houseflies the size of walnuts is news, and Jake and I got up there on the jump. It was terrific! The flies were there all right, but so were a good many other oversized creatures. Roosting in the trees were robins, bluebirds, and doves as large as turkeys. King-sized ducks waddled about importantly, displaying pouter-pigeon crops from overeating. It was as if some god had drawn a line and said : \"This is the new Eden, where all living tilings will prosper terrifically.\" You never saw a sight like it! Or did you? Were you one of the horde who started camping around the Profs magic circle trying to get permission to enter? It was then we got proof that it pays to be kind. Of all the newsgrabbers who surrounded the Profs big wire gate, Jake and I were the only ones who got in. The old man had not forgotten who had taken him seriously and who had made fun of him. Jake snapped a series of startling pics of the oversized animals and birds. I interviewed the Prof again, even got his maid, Tilda\\'s opinions, and wrote it up as unsensationally as possible, playing down the tremendous potential for trouble, placing up the really effective method the old scientist had discovered for \"eliminating the deterioration factor\" in life. I could see where the world was in for some changes, and the going was going to be rough enough for the old man without making it worse. But my efforts came to naught when the pics Jake had taken reached the editor\\'s desk. He hit the ceiling, called me on the carpet, wanted to know where my news sense had gotten lost. Then he sent out three other smart boys to do a good job on it. The paper got out a special edition -- and the troubles I had foreseen began. First, the government stepped in, trying to hush-hush the whole thing; but too late. The rush had started. For miles around the poor Prof\\'s fenced-in hideaway, cars and trailers parked in a mad sensejess jumble. People crowded against the fences and the electricity had to be shut off. Some smart aleck produced wire cutters and made an opening. The invasion of the new Eden had begun. Stegner took flight, taking his secret apparatus and files with him. He declined police escort, and vanished from his mad Eden. Where he went was impossible to learn, but I supposed the government knew. The area he had revitalized with nine davs tile birds. Ap the end of the had triumphed with its usual stupid us remembered, could out. of our minds the significance of what the old man had had pointed the way to a lush immortality, and he had been shoved aside and pawed over and written about like some fredc. If .he had been a notorious criminal, he would have gotten far better journalistic treatment. But the years went by -- four, five of them. And nothing more was heard of Stegner and his work. Until, one day coming home from a night shifttbn the paper, I found a letter in my box. It was a rather plain looking envelope, but much sr than the ordinary. The handwritten address was quite Icgl!e, but very big, as if a giant hand itself to produce ordinary script :  far gotten tne, you. If you would r a time , insert a F in the ect .

But the land of brobdignags I found staggered me. Grasses, trying to be trees, and trees . There were no words for the bigness, the health and vitality of Steg ner and the government who hd welcomed him here in South America. But Stegner hustled me aside before I had time to  do more than goggle at the mainmoth layout of this new Eden under government  supervision.

They can do it, too. Their minds have increased in power. Growth is that way. But moral values are something different -- they are acquired by experience. Find some moral men who might use this information to circumvent what is about to happen.\" I took the papers and shook his gigantic hand. I left via the back door, and sneaked through a clump of giant ferns to the edge of the airfield. A little prowling revealed a parked plane, long unused because those who had flown it here had grown too big to use it. I waited, hidden in the lush greenery until the setting sun would hide my movements. It would only be a few minutes now... The hangar in which the plane was parked contained several gasoline drums, the kind with pumps on them that worked with a crank. I got into the hangar, finally, and before it got too dark to see, checked the plane\\'s gas gauge. It was about a quarter full. I connected the gas hose and started pumping. In twenty minutes I had her full, then I climbed into the plane... When the motor caught, after I was sure it never would, the thunder of the prop brought giants running toward me from the far end of the field, their twenty-foot strides eating up the distance. But I taxied straight toward them, giving the plane\\'s motors all they would take. The plane roared down the field, and they fell flat as the prop came at them. The plane lifted, spun over them, was off. Now slugs from oversize rifles came buzzing about me, crashing through the fuselage. But it was dark and I was away. No serious damage had been done. In Texas it took me four hours to get the brass to listen to me. Finally they did. They didn\\'t ask me to keep my mouth shut. They just turned me loose. I went to my editor and told him the truth. He didn\\'t believe me. When he checked with the army, they said I was obviously trying to perpetrate a hoax. I nearly got fired. waited. I knew I\\'d have to wait until my chance came. There\\' d have to be hellfire before anybody\\'d believe my story. Then the storm broke, in sensational headlines. \"Gigantic beasts wipe out town in South America.\" My editor sent for me. He showed me the headline. \"Maybe I made a mistake not believing your story about Stegner,\" he said. \"I make a lot of mistakes.\" \"You want me to cover this?\" I said. v \"That\\'s it. And if you can come up with proof of what you toldme when you got back from that crazy trip, I\\'ll print every damned word.\" I knew they were at last taking it seriously. The locals had called out the army to fight the strange monsters that were coming out of the jungle. They were such things as army ants six feet long; anteaters looking like ambling locomotives with hairy hides and noses; lumbering sloths vast as a houses on legs, sleepy and comic as ever, but terrifyingly destructive; jaguars like trucks and trailers; centipedes with stingers over their backs that would reach a man in a third-story\\' window; wasps and bees like buzzards. The army was lashing at. these things with machine guns, flame throwers, tanks and rockets. Jeeps careened across the landscape with loads of ammo. It was a madhouse on a vast scale, and being fought to the death. They waited for the beasts to come out of the jungle, then they jumped them -- or were jumped. Nobody was allowed to fly into the hinterland to see where they were coming from. And when I tried to get officials to consider it, they absolutely refused. Up there, it was hinted, were secret government projects -- besides they were too far away -- and radio said there was no sign of anything unusual there. It was worth even a general\\'s job to poke his nose in near those projects. And how could I tell these people traitorous men of their own government were the culprits? It just wasn\\'t possible -- and because I had to stay on the scene, I never even hinted it. I merely waited my chance to produce proof. I knew I\\'d get it, sooner or later. Something would come out of that jungle I\\'d be able to use to convey the real menace to the knowledge of a puzzled world. I wrote carefully, reporting the weird war with the animal world -- and I kept inserting paragraphs hinting about Stcgner and his growth field, adding \"rumors\" that maybe his work had been taken over by a power-mad clique and it was they who were loosing this horror. My  boss liked the stuff I was putting in, because it sold papers, and I was careful to keep my facts separate, and label my theories. Nobody -- at least so it seemed -- believed the theories, but they made good reading. I got a raise in salary. Other reporters were knocking out stories as good as mine, but without the insight into the facts that I had. So their stories went too far afield. Mine became popular, and were in demand as reprints all over the world. But officially, nobody paid any attention to me, so the important papers nestled the bottom of my trunk. I didn\\'t want them confiscated until the time came when I could publish them with proof. My boss would back me up when that proof came. I was sure of that. I got my chance the day the giantess came crashing out of the smoke and dust of the circle of horror across which the beasts were constantly lunging. She was near naked, and half mad with pain from the giant insects plaquing her. No one fired on her as she stood with uplifted arms, waiting for the soldiers to kill her as she expected. Beautiful as a goddess out of an ancient myth she came forward toward the soldiers, her face lighting with hope, her hair streaming golden in the sun. She spoke to us then, and the silence that came over the field of carnage was com\"Look at me! Look at me and believe! There are others like me, back in the jungle; mad giants who plan to conquer your world. They are ready to do it. I have escaped to warn you. They are mad, these giants my master has created. They are monsters...\" I recognized her now. My senses leaped and my blood pounded in my veins. Here was my opportunity to convince the world. This was Tilda, Stegner s maid! I snapped several pictures of her as she went on talking. \"These men, who were once your own leaders are plotting to destroy you and take the world for themselves. You do not know what they are preparing for you, but I come to tell you. Make ready, for they arc on their way to destroy you. They bring huge guns, monster tanks that they have built, machines never before seen on earth.\" What more she might have told we were never to know, for she fell then, at the end of her strength. Whatever she had dared, whatever she had gone through to break out of that monstrous circle and come to us, had been too much even for her giant\\'s strength. She fell, like a tower crashing down, and lay there, a great lax pile of pink and red flesh, torn by thorns, the claws of animals, the stingers of terrible giant insects. Then the monsters came again, and we could not go to her. She lay there as darkness came, and in the morning only her skeleton remained. stripped of flesh in the night by the myriad devouring giant ants and beetles. V photos of Tilda. My editor printed the whole story, printed my formulae, printed every word of the history of Stegner and his creations, and the secret menace he had unwittingly loosed on the world from his second hidden Eden in the jungle. I was called home. They came to me then, those moral ones Stegner had said existed. Men high in government and army circles who had the peace and welfare of the world at heart. Selfless ones whose records were above reproach. And they proved to be high in the powers of the world, able to command. to my reporting. I wanted to be on hand when the attack of which Tilda had warned became reality... I was some twelve miles from the deadly circle when the giant tanks appeared. They were larger than any moving thing ever seen on Earth before. Tracklayers, caterpillars -- and swinging above them slender towers which bore ominous gleaming nozzles. On they came. Then they struck at us. From the unnameable, that swept forward like a slow lightning, a kind of crackling sheet of cold fire that spread from tower to tower, in an arc that began to bend toward our lines. The fire came in mile-wide swaths. There was no outcry, no terror -- just the sweating lines of men in foxholes, the crews about the guns, heaving ammo into their maws; the rumbling trucks and the careening jeeps. The fire swept over all like liquid radiance, like a pouring out of moonlight, soft but was gone. And when it had gone, nothing but silence remained. Dead men stretched out where they  had lain waiting, fallen where they labored ; jeeps careened on to crash into, stumps or bigger trucks -- and stop forever, Only silence and death and nothingness was left. When the silence swept across the whole front I dropped my glasses and lit out for my own car, and headed for the coast. I wanted to file this story in person, and I knew, too, that army would not be there in the morning. I meant to stay alive. I knew that the hope for mankind lay in what honest men were doing with Stegner\\'s formulae. I had to know. So I fled. Next day they were dropping atom bombs on every moving thing in Stegncr\\'s ghastly Eden. High flying bombers flew in swarms -- and many of them were being shot down by the weird fire. I saw those atom bombs falling, on television, and the white radiance reaching up toward them. I saw\\' it catch them in its embrace, saw them explode harmlessly in the air, midway in in their plunge. Whatever the fire was, it was a defense against the atom bomb, for it exploded them before they could reach their targets.  It didn\\'t catch them all, and it didn\\'t intercept all the high-flying bombers loosing their guided rocket missiles. It got enough though, to show us we were on the losing end. What we needed was a miracle. And the miracle did occur... At first, even with my fingers on every tag end of information that came out of the terrible area, it was an unnoticeable change. Then I got it. The men doing our fighting changed in caliber and ability. I never learned, due to the official habit of hushing everything up, just whose technology accomplished the miracle, but it must have been started from the first, with those army officers who had listened to me with such lack of interest when I spoke before their inquisition at the Texas army air field. All I learned was that there was a new kind of man busy at the front, a man of keener intellect, swifter of action, infinitely more able than the former ordinary soldier. It was Jake who first confirmed my suspicions. He brought in photographs of men lifting trucks out of mudholes, men tearing steel cables apart with their bare hands, men jumping over twenty-foot barriers with full pack. \"Whatta I do with that kind of pic? The people are so fed up with the impossible news they are getting that they don\\'t believe anything any more! But you and I know a news camera doesn\\'t lie... it doesn\\'t have\\' time!\" They had put the Profs formulae to work against the giants. This time it was the right formulae. They had growth without increase in size, a growth of ability, of strength, of mentality, without any increase in ponderous structure. These new soldiers were the policemen of the United Nations made into supermen! I began to believe in the human race again. \"Great!\" I said. \"This iswhat I\\'ve been waiting for!\" Jake tossed me his pictures and went away. I turned to the typewriter and began batting out my story: \"Mankind solves the problem of giantism! The new weapon against the giants is -- the new man!\" Those little giants waded into that circle through all the deadly fire and the giant scorpions and vast beasts like Jack-the-GiantKiller\\'s multitudinous sons -- and it wasn\\'t a month later that I typed the last story of my life and gave up reporting for good. It was the tale of the death of the last giant -- and Jake\\'s picture of him, armed in the end with only his fists, huge as a tree, mad with hunger and thirst and terrible fear of the little men who were just as mighty, a lot quicker, and every bit as smart as any giant. They routed him out with tear gas and shot him down with plain old GI rifle fire. Yes, I gave up newspaper work. Why? They offered me a job making a movie out of the \"War of the Giants\". The job gave me quick money, which is what I needed.  The wife and I are starting a new colony on Malino Island. It\\'s in the Carelinas. We\\'re going to try this growth-without-size business out properly. Yes, that\\' s my son. Eight months.

Lucinda came with him, hooking her arm through his. Suddenly he stopped, and without looking at her, asked quietly, \"That policeman was a manipulated, undignified fool, wasn\\'t he?\" \"Of course he was, darling, and it made a man of him.\" He nodded as if accepting a statistic, and, kissing her, walked out I of the house.

My! you had Canadian bacon for breakfast.\" She darted in past Lucinda, a small, wiry, vibrant girl with sunlit hair and moonlit eyes. \"Can I help with the dishes?\" \"Thank you, you doll.\" Lucinda took down a shallow glass bowl for the violets. Jenny busily ran hot water into the sink. \"I couldn\\'t help seeing,\" she said. \"Your big picture window... Lucinda, you never leave the breakfast dishes. I keep telling Bob, some day I\\'ll have the routines you have, everything always so neat, never running out of anything, never in a hurry, never surprised... anyway, all the way over I could see you just sitting by the table there, and the dishes not done and all... is everything all right? I mean, don\\'t tell me if I shouldn\\'t ask, but I couldn\\'t help... Her voice trailed off into an ardent and respectful mumble. \"You\\'re such a sweetheart,\" Lucinda said mistily. She came over to the sink carrying clean dishtowels and stood holding them, staring out past Jenny\\'s head to the level lawns of the village. \"Actually, I did have something on my mind... something . , She related the whole conversation over breakfast that morning, from her abrupt and partial mentioning of the anecdote about the blonde and the policeman, to her husband\\'s extraordinary andunequivocal statement about women\\'s power over men: This has bee?i go ing on too long. I shall alter it. \"Is that all?\" Jenny asked when she had finished. \"Mm. It\\'s all that was said.\" \"Oh, I don\\'t think you should worry about that.\" She crinkled up her eyes, and Lucinda understood that she was putting herself and her young husband in the place of Lucinda and Dr. Lefferts, and trying to empathize a solution. \"I think you might have hurt his feelings a little, maybe,\" Jenny said at length. \"I mean, you admitted that you handled him in much the same way as that blonde handled the policeman, and then you said the policeman was a fool\" Lucinda smiled. \"Very shrewd. And what\\'s your guess about that parting shot?\" Jenny turned to face her. \"You\\'re not teasing me, asking my opinion, Lucinda? I never thought I\\'d see the day l Not you -- you\\'re so wise!\" Lucinda patted her shoulder. \"The older I get, the more I feel that among women there is a lowest common denominator of wisdom, and that the chief difference between them is a random scattering of blind spots. No, honey, I\\'m not teasing you. You may be able to see just where I can\\'t. Now tell me: what do you think he meant by that?\\' # \" e I shall alter it\\', Jenny quoted thoughtfully. \"Oh, I don\\'t think he meant anything much. You showed him how you could make him do things, and he didn\\'t like it. He\\'s decided not to let you do it any more, but -- but... \"But what?\" \"Well, it\\'s tike with Bob. When he gets masterful and lays down the law I just agree with him. He forgets about it soon enough. If you agree with men all the time they cant get stubborn about anything.\"Lucinda laughed aloud. \"There\\'s the wisdom!\" she cried. Sobering, site shook her head. \"You don\\'t know the doctor the way I do. He\\'s a great man -- a truly great one, with a great mind. It\\' great in a way no other mind has ever been. H#V- different. Jenny, I know how people talk, and what a lot of them say. People wonder why I married him, why I\\'ve stayed with him all these years. They say he\\'s stuffy and didactic and that he has no sense of humor, Weil, to them he may be ; but to me hfc is a continual challenge. The rules-ofthumb that keep most men in line don\\'t apply to him. \"And if he says he can do something, he can. If he says he will do something, he will.\" Jenny dried her hands and sat down slowly. \"He meant,\" she said positively, \"that he would alter your ability to make him do things. Because die only other thing he could have meant was that he was going to alter the thing that makes it possible for any woman to handle any man. And that just couldn\\'t be. How could he change human nature?\" \"How? How? He\\'s the scientist. I\\'m not. I simply eliminate that \\'how\\' from my thinking. The worrisome thing about it is that he doesn\\'t think in small ways about small issues. I\\'m afraid that\\'s just what he meant -- that he was going to change some factor in humanity that is responsible for this power we have over men.\" \"Oh... really.\" said Jenny. She looked up at Lucinda, moved her hands uneasily. \"Lucinda, I know how great the doctor is, and how much you think of him, but -- but no one man could do such a thing! Not ouside of his own home.\" She grinned fleetingiy. \"Probably not inside of it, for very long... I never understood just what sort of a scientist he is. Can you tell me, I mean, aside from any secret projects he might be on? Like Bob, now; Bob\\'s a hightemperature metallurgist. What is the doctor, exactly?\" \"That\\'s the right question to ask,\" Lucinda said, and her voice was shadowed. \"Dr. Lefferts is a -- well, the closest you could get to it would be to call him a specializing non-specialist. You see, science has reached the point where each branch of it continually branches into specialties, and each specialty has its own crop of experts. Most experts live in the confines of their own work. The doctor was saving just the other day that he\\'d discovered a fluorine-boron step-reaction in mineralogy that had been known for so long that the mineralogists had forgotten about it -- yet it was unknown to metallurgy. Just as I said a moment ago, his mind is great, and -- different. His job is to draw together the chemists and the biologists, the pure mathematicians and the practical physicists, the clinical psychologists and the engineers and all the otherists andologies. His specialty is scientific thought as applied to all the sciences. He has no assignments except to survey all the fields and transfer needed information from one to the other. There has never been such a position in the Institute before, nor a man to fill it. And there is no other institute like this one on earth. \"He has entree into every shop and lab and library in this Institute, He can do anything or get anything done in any of them. \"And when he said T shall alter that he meant what he said!\" #I T never knew that\\'s what he did, # breathed Jenny. \"I never knew that\\'s what... who he is. # \"That\\'s who he is.\" \"But what can he change Jenny burst out. \"What can he change in us, in all men, in all women? What is the power he\\'s talking about, and where does it come from, and what wou will... happen if it\\'s changed?\" \"I don\\'t know,\" Lucinda said thought! ully, # # I -- do- -- not -- know. f # fof nrir!p in tbs rrtnwrf i\\'KIa that sort of thing is just one of the things a woman naturally does, because she Is a woman, without thinking of it.\" Unexpectedly, Jenny giggled. \"You don\\'t plan those things. You just do them. It\\'s nice when it works. A better roast from the butcher. A reminder from one of the men at the bank that a check\\'s overdrawn, in time to cover it.\" \"I know, # \\' smiled Lucinda, \"I know\\'. It\\'s easy and inaccurate to say that all those men are on the prowl -- or all those women either. A few are, but most are not. The women has survived even equal opportunity and equal pay for women. The ability of women to get what they want from men lies completely in their knowledge of that band wants to alter -- will alter -- lies in that department. \"Lucinda, why don\\'t you just ask him?\" \"I shall. But I don\\'t know if I\\'ll get an answer. If he regards it as a security matter, nothing will get it out of him.\" # # You I #I tell me, won\\'t you?\" \"Jenny, my sweet, if he tells me nothing, I can\\'t tell you. If he tells me and asks me to keep his confidence, I won\\'t tell you. If he tells me and puts no restrictions on it. I\\'ll tell you everything.\" \"But -- \"  \"I know, dear. You\\'re thinking that it\\'s a bigger thing than just what it might mean to the two of us. Well, you\\'re right. But deep I\\'m confidents I\\'d pit women again?    pect them to win out. But anytime all womankind is against all mankind, the men don\\'t stand a chance. Think hard about it, anyway. At least we should be able to figure out where the attack is coming from.\" \"At least you admit it\\'s an attack\" #  \"You bet your sweet life it\\'s an attack. There\\'s been a woman behind most thrones all through history. The few times that hasn\\'t been true, it\\'s taken a woman to clean up the mess afterward. We won\\'t give up easily, darling!\" blow\\', and we shall have snow\\', and so on \" said Lucinda as she lit the fire. \"I\\'m going to need a new coat.\" \"Very well,\" said Dr. LefTerts. \"A fur coat this time.\" \"Fur coats,\" pronounced the doctor, \"are impractical. Get one with the fur inside. You\\'ll keep warmer with less to carry\\'.\" \"I want a fur coat with the fur outside, where it shows.\" \"I understand and at times admire the decorative compulsions,\" said the doctor, rising from the adjusted cube he used for an easy chair, \"but not when they are unhealthy, uneconomical, and inefficient. My dear, vanity does not become you.\" \"A thing that has always fascinated me \" said Lucinda in a dangerously quiet voice, \"in rabbits, weasels, skunks, pumas, pandas, and mink, and all other known mammals and marsupials, is their huge vanity. They all wear their fur outside.\" He put on his pince-nez to stare at her. \"Your logic limits its factors. I find such sequences remarkable because of the end results one may obtain. However, I shall not follow this one.\" \"If you\\'re so preoccupied with efficiency and function,\" she snapped, \"why do you insist on wearing those pince-nez instead of getting corneal lenses?\" \"Functional living is a pattern which includes all predictable phenomena,\" he said reasonably. \"One of these is habit. I recognize that I shall continue to like pincenez as much as I shall continue to dislike rice pudding. My functionalism therefore includes these glasses and excludes that particular comestible. If you had the fur-coat habit, the possibility of a fur coat would be calculable. Since you have never had such a coat, we\\' can consider the matter disposed of.\" \"I think some factors were selected for that sequence,\" said Lucinda between her teeth, \"but I can\\'t seem to put my finger on the missing ones.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I said,\" appended Lucinda distinctly, \"that speaking of factors, I wonder how you\\'re coming with your adjustment of human nature to eliminate the deadliness of the female.\" \"Oh, that. I expect results momentarily.\" \"Why bother?\" she said bitterly. \"My powers don\\'t seem to be good enough for a fur coat as it is.\" \"Oh,\" he said mildly, \"wereyou using them? # \\' Because she was Lucinda, she laughed. \"No, darling, I wasn\\'t;\\' She went to him and pressed him hack into the big cubical chair and sat on the arm. \"I was demanding, cynical, and unpleasant. These things in a woman represent the scorched earth retreat, rather than the looting advance.\" \"An excellent analogy\\' he said. \"Excellent. It has been a long and bitter war, hasn\\'t it? And now it\\'s coming to an end. It is an extraordinary thing that in our difficult progress toward the elimination of wars, we have until now ignored the greatest and most pernicious conflict of all -- the one between the sexes.\" \"Why so pernicious?\" she chuckled. \"There are times when it\\'s rather fun.\" He said solemnly, \"There are moments of exhilaration, even of glory, in every great conflict. Rut such conflicts tear down so much more than they build.\" \"What\\'s been so damaging about the war between the spxes?\" \"Though it has been the women who made men, it has been largely men who have made the world as we know it. However, they have had to do so against a truly terrible obstacle: . the emotional climate created by women. Only by becoming an ascetic can a man avoid the oscillations between intoxication and distrust instilled into him by women. And ascetics usually are already insane or rapidly become so.\" \"I think you\\'re overstating a natural state of affairs.\" # T am overstating # he admitted, \"for clarity\\'s sake, and off the record. However, this great war is by no means natural On the contrary, it is a most unnatural state of affairs. You see, homo sapieris is, in one small but important respect, an atypical mammal\" \"Do tell.\" He raised his eyebrows, but continued. \"In virtually all species hut ours, the female has a rigidly fixed cycle of conjugal acceptability.\" \"But the human female has a -- \" \"I am not referring to that lunar cycle, unmentionable everywhere except in blatant magazine advertisements # he said shortly, \"but to a cycle of desire. Of rut.\" \"A pretty word.\" Her eyes began to glitter. \"Mahomet taught that it occurred every eight days, Zoroaster nine days, Socrates and Solon agreed on ten. Everyone e#e, as far as I can discover, seems to disagree with these pundits, or to ignore the matter. Actually there are such cycles, but they are subtle at best, and differ in the individual from time to time, with age, physical experience, geography, and even emotional state. These cycles are vestigial; the original, natural cycle disappeared early in the history of the species, and has been trembling on the verge ever since. It will be a simple matter to bring it back.\" \"May I ask how?\" \"You may not. It is a security matter.\" \"May I then ask what effect you expect this development to have?\" \"Obvious, isn\\'t it? The source of woman\\'s persistent and effective control over man, the thing that makes him subject to all her intolerances, whims, and bewildering coyness, is the simple fact of her perennial availability. She has no regular and predictable cycle of desire. The lower animals have. During the brief time that a female mouse, a marten, or a mare is approachable, every male of her species in the vicinity will know of it and seek her out; will, in effect, drop everything to answer a basic call. But unless and until that call occurs, the male is free to think of other things. With the human female, on the other hand, the call is mildly present at all times, and the male is never completely free to think of other things. It is natural for this drive to be strong. It is unnatural indeed for it to be constant. In this respect Freud was quite correct; nearly every neurosis has a sexual Ijasis. We are a race of neurotics, and the great wonder is that we have retained any of the elements of sanity at all. I shall liberate humanity from this curse. I shall restore the natural alternations of drive and rest. I shall free men to think and women to take their rightful places as thinking individuals beside them, rather than be the forced-draft furnaces of sexual heat they have become.\" \"Are you telling me,\" sajd Lucinda in a small, shocked voice, \"that you have found a way to -- to neuterize women except for a few hours a month?\" \"I am and I have,\" said Dr. Lefferts. \"And incidentally, I must say I am grateful to you for having turned me to this problem.\" He looked up sharply. \"Where are you going, my dear?\" \\'Tve got to ththink,\" said Lucinda, and ran from the room. If she had stayed there for another fifteen seconds, she knew she would have crushed his skull in with the poker. W HO -- Oh, Lucinda! How nice. Come in... why, what\\'s the matter?\" \"Jenny, Tve got to talk to you. Is Bob home?\" \"No. He\\'s got night duty at the high temperature lab this week. Whatever is wrong?\" \"It\\'s the end of the world,\" said Lucinda in real anguish. She sank down on the sofa and looked up at the younger woman. \"My husband is putting a -- a chastity belt on every woman on earth.\" \"A what?\" \"A chastity belt.\" She began to laugh hysterically. \"With a timelock on it.\" c Jenny sat beside her. \"Don\\'t,\" she said. \"Don\\'t laugh like that. You\\'re frightening me.\" Lucinda lay back, gasping. \"You should be frightened... Listen to me, Jenny. Listen carefully, because this is the biggest thing that has happened since the deluge.\" She began to talk. Five minutes later Jenny asked dazedly, \"You mean-if this crazy thing happens Bob won\\'t... won\\'t want me most of the time?\" \"It\\'s you who won\\'t do .any wanting. And when you don\\'t, he won\\'t want either... It isn\\'t that that bothers me so much, Jenny, now that I\\'ve had a chance to think about it. Fm worried about the revolution.\" # \\'What revolution?\" \"Why, this is going to cause the greatest social upheaval of all time! Once these cycles become recognized for what they are, there will be fireworks. Look at the way we dress, the \\'way we use cosmetics. Why do we do it? Basically, to appear to be available to men. Practically all perfumes have a musk or musk-like base for that very reason. But how long do you think women will keep up the hypocrisy of lipstick and plunging necklines when men know better -- know that they couldn\\'t possibly be approachable all the time? How many men will let their women appear in pub lie looking as if they were?\" \"They\\'ll tie us up in the house the way I do Mitzi-poodle,\" said Jenny in an awed tone. \"They\\'ll leave us smugly alone with easy minds for three weeks out of four,\" said Lucinda, \"and stand guard over us like bull elks the rest of the time, to keep other men away.\" \"Lucinda!\" Jenny squeaked and covered her face in horror. \"What about other women? How can we compete with another woman when she\\'s -- she\\'s -- and we\\'re not?\" \"Especially when men are conditioned the way they are. Women will want to stick to one man, more likely than not. But men -- men, building up pressures for weeks on end... \" \"There\\'ll be harems again,\" said Jenny. \"This is the absolute, final, bitter end of any power we ever had over the beasts, Jenny -- do you see that? All the old tricks -- the arch halfpromise, the come-on, the manipulations of jealousy -- they!! be utterly meaningless! The whole arsenal of womankind is based on her ability to yield or not to yield. And my husband is going to take the choice away from us. He\\'s going to make it absolutely certain that at  one time we can\\'t yield, and at another we must!\" \"And they\\'ll never have to be nice to us at either time,\" added Jenny miserably. \"Women,\" said Lucinda bitterly, \"are going to have to work for a living.\" \"But we do!\" \"Oh, you know what I mean, J enny! The iit-tul wife in the lit-fcul ome... that whole concept is based on women\\'s perpetual availability. We\\'re not going to be able to be home-makers, in that sense, at monthly intervals.\" Jenny jumped up. Her face was chalky. \"He hasn\\'t stopped any war,\" she ground out. Lucinda had never seen her like this. \"He\\'s started one, and it\\'s a beaut. Lucinda, he\\'s got to be stopped, even if you -- we have to... \"Gome on.\" They started for Dr. Lefferts\\' house, striding along dike a couple of avenging angels. A h ; # said dr. lefferts, rising politely. \"You brought Jenny. Good evening. Jenny.\" Lucinda planted herself in front of him and put her hands on her hips. \"\\'You listen to me,\" she no growled. \"You\\'ve got to stop that nonsense about changing women.\" \"It is not nonsense and I shall do nothing of the kind \" \"Dr Lefferts,\" said Jenny in a quaking voice, \"can you really do this -- tins awful thing?\" \"Of course,\" said the doctor. \"It was quite simple, once the principles were worked out. # \" \"It was quite simple? You mean you\\'ve already -- \" Dr. Lefferts looked at his watch. \"At two o\\'clock this afternoon. Seven hours ago.\" \"I think,\" said Lucinda quietly, \"that you had better tell us just exactly what you did, and what we can expect.\" \"I told you it is a security matter\" \"What has my libido to do with national defense?\" \"That,\" said the doctor, in a tone which referred to that as the merest trifle, \"is a side issue. I coincided it with a much more serious project.\" \"What could be more serious than... \"There\\'s only one thing that serious, from a security standpoint,\" said Lucinda. She turned to the doctor. \"I know better than to ask you any direct questions. But if I assume that this horrible thing was done in conjunction with a super-bomb test -- just a guess, you understand -- is there any way for an H-blast to bring about a change in women such as you describe?\" He clasped both hands around one knee and looked up at her in said... \"And most skilfully phrased. Speaking hypothetically -- hypothetically, you understand,\" he interjected, waving a warning finger, \"a hydrogen bomb has an immense power of diffusion. A jet of energy of that size, at that temperature, for even three or four microseconds, is capable of penetrating the upper reaches of the stratosphere. But the effect does not end there. The upward displacement causes great volumes of air to rush in toward the rising column from all sides. This in turn is carried upward and replaced, a process which continues for a considerable time. One of the results must be the imbalance of any distinct high or low pressure areas within several thousand miles, and for a day or two freak weather developments can be observed. In other words, these primary and secondary effects are capable of diffusing a -- ah -- substance placed in the bomb throughout the upper atmosphere, where, in a matter of days, it will be diffused throughout the entire envelope.\" Lucinda clasped her hands in a slow, controlled way, as if one of them planned to immobilize the other and thereby keep both occupied. \"And is there any substance... , I\\'m still asking hypothetical questions, you understand -- is there anything which could be added to the hydrogen fusion reaction which might bring about these -- these new cycles in women?\" \"\\'They are not new cycles,\" said the doctor flatly. \"They are as old as the development of warmblooded animals. The lack of them is, in biological terms, a very recent I ! development in an atypical mamma #; so recent and so small that it is subject to adjustment. As to your hypothetical question -- \" he smiled -- \"I should judge that such an effect is perfectly possible. Within the extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation which take place in a fusion reaction, many things are possible. A minute quantity of certain alloys, for example, introduced into the shell of the bomb itself, or perhaps in die structure of a supporting tower or even a nearby temporary shed, might kky a number of phenomenal reaction chains. Such a chain might go through several phases and result in certain subtle isotopic alterations in one of the atmosphere\\'s otherwise inert gases, say xenon. And this isotope, acting upon the adrenal cortex and the parathyroid, which are instrumental in controlling certain cycles in the human body, might very readily brin about the effect we are discussing in an atypical species.\" Lucinda threw up her hands and turned to Jenny. \"Then that\\'s it,\" she said wearily. \"What\\'s \\'it\\'? What? I don\\'t understand,\" whimpered Jenny. \"What\\'s he done, Lucinda?\" \"In his nasty, cold-blooded hypothetical way,\" said Lucinda, \"he has put something in or near an H-bomb. which was tested today, which is going to have some effect on the air we breathe, which is going to do what we were discussing at your house.\" \"Dr. Lefferts,\" said Jenny piteously. She went to him, stood looking down at him as he sat primly in his big easy chair. \"Why -- why? Ju gt to annoy us? Just to keep us from having a little, petty influence over you?\" \"By no means # said the doctor. \"I will admit that I might have turned my attention to the matter f for such reasons. But some concentrated thought brought up a number of extra-pol ations which are by no means petty.\" mantel, pince-nez in hand, the perfect picture of the Pedant At Home. \"Consider,\" he said. \"\\'Homo sapiens , in terms of comparative anatomy, should mature physically at # and emotionally between # and #. He should have a life expectancy of between # and # years. And he unquestionably should be able to live a life uncluttered by such insistent trifles as clothing conventions, unfunctional chivalries, psychic turmoils and dangerous mental and physical escapes into what the psychologists call romances. Women should phase their sexual cycles with those of the seasons, gestate their young longer, and eliminate the unpredictable nature of their psychosexual appetites -- the very basis of s all their insecurity and therefore that of most men. Women will not be chained to these cycles, Jenny, and become breeding machines, if that\\'s what you fear. You will begin to live in and with these cycles as you live with a well-made and serviced automatic machine. You wall be liberated from the constant control and direction of your gomalic existence as you have been liberated from shifting gears in vour car.\"  \"But... we\\'re not conditioned for such a change!\" blazed Lucinda. \"And what of the fashion industry... cosmetics... the entertainment world... what\\'s going to become of these and the them, and the people dependent on all those people if you do a thing like this?\"  \"The tiling is done. As for these people... tie paused. \"Yes, there will be some disturbance. A considerable one. But in overall historical terms, it will be slight and it will be brief. I like to think that the television service man is one who was liberated by the cotton gin and the power loom.\" \"It\\'s... hard to think in historical terms just now.\" said Lucinda. \"Jenny, come on.\" \"Where are you going?\" She faced him, her blued-steel eyes blazing. \"Away from you. And I -- I think I have a warning to give to the women.\" \"I wouldn\\'t do that,\" he said dryly. \"They\\'ll find out in time. All you\\'ll succeed in doing is to alert many women to the fact that they will be unattractive to their husbands at times when other women may seem more desirable. Women will not unite with one another, my dear, even to unite against men\" There was a tense pause. Then jenny quavered, \"How long did you say this -- this thipg will take?\" \"I did not say. I would judge between thirty-six and forty-eight hours.\" \"I\\'ve got to get home.\" \"May I come with you?\" asked Lucinda. Jenny looked at her, her full face, her ample, controlled body, A surprising series of emotions chased themselves across her young face. She said, \"I don\\'t think... I mean... no, not tonight; I have to -- to -- goodnight, Lucinda.\" When she had gone, the doctor uttered one of his rare chuckles. \"She has absorbed perhaps a tenth of this whole concept,\" he said, \"but until she\\'s surer of herself she\\'s not going to let you or any woman near her husband.\" \"You... you complacent pig ! # said Lucinda whitely. She stormed upstairs. \"Lucinda I I\\'m -- glad you called.\" Something cold and tense deep inside Lucinda relaxed. She sat down slowly on the couch, leaned back comfortably with the telephone cradled between her cheek and her wide soft shoulder. \"I\\'m glad you\\'re glad, Jenny darling. It\\'s been six weeks... how are you?\" \"I\\'m... all right now. It was pretty awful, for a while, not knowing how it would be, waiting for it to happen. And when it did happen, it was hard to get used to. But it hasn\\'t changed things too much. How about you?\" \"Oh, I\\'m fine,\" said Lucinda. She smiled slowly, touched her tongue to her full lower lip. \"Jenny, have you told anyone?\" \"Not a soul. Not even Bob. I p think he\\'s a little bewildered. He thinks I\\'m being very... understanding. Lucinda, is it wrong for me to let him think that?\" \"It\\'s never wrong for a woman to keep her knowledge to herself if it makes her more attractive,\" said Lucinda, and smiled again. \"How\\'s t)r. Lefferts?\" \"He\\'s bewildered too. I suppose I\\'ve been a little... understanding too.\" She chuckled. Over the phone she heard Jenny\\'s answering laughter. \"The poor things,\" she said. \"The poor, poor things. Lucinda -- \" \"Yes, honey.\" U I know how to handle this, now. But I don\\'t really understand it. Do you?\" \"Yes, I think I do.\" \"How can it be, then? How can this change in us affect men that way? I thought we would be the ones who would be turned off and on like a neon sign.\" tc What? Now wait a minute, Jenny! You mean you don\\'t realize what\\'s happened?\" \"That\\'s what I just said. How could such a change in women do such a thing to the men?\" \"Jenny, I think you\\'re wonderful, wonderful, wonderful,\" breathed Lucinda. \"As a matter of fact, I think women are wonderful. I suddenly realized that you haven\\'t the foggiest notion of what\\'s happened, yet you\\'ve taken it in stride and used it exactly right!\" \"Whatever do you mean?\" \"Jenny., do you fee any difference in yourself?\" \"Why, no. All die difference is in Bob. That\\'s what I -- \" \"Honey, there isn\\'t any difference in you, nor in me, nor in any other woman. For the very first time in his scientific life, the great man made an error in his calculations.\"  There was silence for a time, then the telephone uttered a soft, delighted, long-drawn-out \"Oh-hh-h-h...\" Lucinda said, \\'He\\'s sure that in the long run it will have all the benefits he described -- die longer life expectancy, the subduing of insecurities, the streamlining of our manners and customs.\" \"You mean that all men from now on will... \" \"I mean that for about twelve days in every two weeks, men can\\'t do anything with us, which .is restful. And for forty-eight hours they can\\'t do anything without us, which is -- \" She laughed. u -- useful. It would seem that homo sapiens is still an atypical mammal.\" Jenny\\'s voice was awed. \"And I thought we were going to lose the battle of the sexes. Bob brings me little presents every single day, Lucinda!\" \\'He\\'d better. Jenny, put down that phone and come over here. I want to hug you.

After twenty minutes, a single air lock swung clear and a dozen armed men in Company uniforms went aboard. Still later, a truck lumbered up, the cargo hatch creaked aside, and a crane reached its long neck in for the cargo. Still no creature from the ship was seen to emerge. The truck driver, idly smoking near the hull, knew this was the Prescott , in from the Jupiter run -- that this was the White Sands Space Port, But he didn\\'t know what was inside the Prescott and he\\'d been told it wasn\\'t healthy to ask. Cene O\\'Neil stood outside the electrified ware that surrounded the White Sands port and thought of many tilings. He thought of the eternal secrecy surrounding space travel; of the reinforced hush-hush enshrouding Company ships. No one ever visited the engine rooms. No one in all the nation had ever talked with a spaceman. Gene thought of the glimpse he\\'d gotten of the thing in the pilot\\'s window.

And there was a place where you could do the sitting in complete comfort , Where Whiting done it -- but only to vanish off face of \\' the earth. Damn Carter to all hell! Gene turned and walked up the sandy road toward the place where the gaudy neons of the Blue Moon told hard working men where they could spend their money. The Blue Moon. It was quite a place. Outside, beneath the big crescent sign, Gene stopped to watch the crowds eddying in and out. Then he went in, to watch them cluster around the slot machines and bend in eager rows over the view slots of the peep shows. He moved into the bar, dropped low stools. He ordered  eyes drift around, beside him. He \"Ain\\'t o\\'s been asking quesdown at the \\'b face was He as if he was well dressed, with sever can give yon want -- for a price, nodded toward an e? lie in here, xl \\' -- \" # \" he thought, move over here I come , and toward the door.    theman waite Gene moved up close. \"You see, it\\'s this way Something exploded against Gene\\'s skull. Even as fiery darkness closed down he knew he\\'d found the way. But only a stupid newspaperman would take? it. Damn Carter! Gene went out. He seemed to be dreaming. Over him bent a repulsive, man-like face. But the man had fingernails growing on his chin where his whiskers should have been. And his eyes were funny -- walled, as though he bordered on idiocy. In the dream, Gene felt himself strapped into a hammock. Then somethin at him and made a terrible rac for a long time. Then it  j quiet except\\' for a t head. He went back to slee outfit, but it uniform. There and what there the back w there. It was a nurse to   Her soft hands fixed something over his eyes, something cold and wet. He felt grateful, but kept on trying to remember. Ah, he had it; the girls wore that kind of outfit in the Blue Moon in one of the skits they did, burlesquing a hospital. He took off the wet cloth and looked again. She was a dream. Even with her lips rougescarlet, her cheeks pink with makeup, her eyes heavy with artiface. \"What gives, beautiful ?\" He was surprised at the weakness of his voice. Her voice was hard, but nice, and it was bitter, as though she wanted hard people to know she knew the score, could be just a little harder. \"You\\'re a spaceman now! Didn\\'t you know?\" Gene grinned weakly. # T don\\'t know a star from a street light. Nobody gets on the space crews these days -- it\\'s a closed union.\" Her laugh was full of a knowledge denied him. \"That\\'s what I used to think!\" She began to unstrap him from the hammock. Then she pushed back his hair, prodded at the purple knob on his head with careful fingertips. \"How come you\\'re on this ship?\\' asked Gene, wincing but letting her fingers explore. \"Shanghaied, same as you. I\\'m from the Blue Moon. I stepped out between acts for a breath of fresh air, and wham, a sack over the head and here I am. They thought you might have a cracked skull. One of the monsters told me to check you. No doctor on the ship.\" Gene groaned. \"Then I didn\\'t dream it -- there is a guy on this ship with fingernails instead of a beard on his chin!\" She nodded. \"You haven\\'t seen anything yet!\" \"Why are we here?\" \"You\\'ve been shanghaied to work the ship. Frn here for a different purpose -- these men can\\'t get off the ship and they\\'ve got to be kept them contented. We\\'ve got ourselves pleasant jobs, with monsters for playmates, and we can\\'t get fired. It\\'ll be the rottenest time of our lives, and the rest of our lives, as far as I can see.\" Gene sank down, put the compress back on his bump. \"I don\\'t get it.\" \"You will. Fm not absolutely sure Fm right, but I know a little more about it than you.\" \"What\\'s your name?\"\\' \"They call me Queenie Brant. A name that fits this business. My real name is Ann O\\'Donnell.\" \"Queenie\\'s a horse\\'s name -- I\\'ll call you Ann. Me, Fm Gene O\\'Neil.\" \"That makes us both Irish,\" she said. He lifted the compress and saw the first really natural smile on her face. It was a sweet smile, introspective, dewy, young. \"You were only a dancer\" He said it flatly. For a long instant she looked at him. \"Thanks. You got inside the gate on that one.\" \"It\\'s in your eyes Fm glad to know you, Ann. And I\\'d like to know you better.\" \"You will. There\\'ll be plenty of time  we\\'re bound for lo.\" \"Where\\'s Io?\" \"One of Jupiter\\'s moons, you Irish ignoramus. It has quite a colony around the mines. Also it has a strange race of people. But Ann O\\'Donnell is going to live there if she can get off this ship. I don\\'t want fingernails growing on my chin.\" O\\'Neil sat up. \"I get it now! It\\'s something about the atomic drive that changes the crew!\" \"What else?\" Gene looked at Ann, let his eyes rove over her figure. \"Take a good look,\" she said bit\\' terly. \"Maybe it won\\'t stay like this very long!\" . \"We\\'ve got to get off this ship!\" said Gene hoarsely... opened. A sharp-nosed face peered in, followed by a misshapen body of a man in a dirty blue uniform. Hair grew thick all around his neck and clear up to his ears. It also covered the skin from chin to shirt opening. The hair bristled, coarse as an animal\\'s. His voice was thick, his words hissing as though his tongue was too heavy to move properly. \"Captain wants you, O\\'Neil.\" Gene got up, took a step. He went clear across the room, banged against the wall. The little man laughed. \"We\\'re in space \" Ann said. \"We have a simulated gravity about a quarter normal. Here, let me put on your metal-soled slippers. They\\'re magnetized to hold you to the floor \" She bent and slipped the things on his feet, while Gene held his throbbing head. The little man opened the door and went out. Gene followed, his feet slipping along awkwardly. After a minute his nausea lessened. At the end of the long steel corridor the little man knocked, then opened the door to a low\\' rumble of command. He didn\\'t enter, just stood aside for Gene. Gene walked in, stood staring. The eyes in the face he saw were black pools of nothingness, without emotion, yet behind them an active mind was apparent. Gene realized this hairy thing was the Captaineven though he didn\\'t even wear a shirt! \"You\\'ve shanghaied me,\" said Gene. \"I don\\'t like it.\" The voice was huge and cold, like wind from an ice field. \"None of us like it, chum. But the ships have got to sail. You\\'re one of us now\\', because we\\'re on our way and by the time you get there, there\\'ll be no place left for you to work, unless it\\'s in a circus as a freak.\" \"I didn\\'t ask for it,\" said Gene. \"You did. You wanted to know too much about the crew -- and if you found out, you\\'d spread it. You see, the drives are not what they were cooked up to be -- the atomics leak, and it wasn\\'t found out until too late. After they learned, they hid the truth, because the cargo we bring is worth mil lions. All the shielding they\\'ve used so far only seems to make it worse. But that won\\'t stop the ships -- they\\'ll get crews the way they got you, and nosey people will find out more than they bargain for.\" \"I won\\'t take it sitting down!\" said Gene angrily. The Captain ignored him. \"Start saying sir. It\\'s etiquette aboard ship to say sir to the Captain. \\'Til never say sir to anyone who got me into this...\" The Captain knocked him down. Gene had plenty of time to block the blow. He had put up his arms, but the big fist went right through and crashed against his chin. Gene sat down hard, staring up at the hairy thing that had once been a man. He suddenly realized the Captain was standing there waiting for an excuse to kill him. Through split and bleeding lips, while his stomach turned over and his head seemed on the point of bursting. Gene said: \"Yes, sir!\" The Captain turned his back, sat down again. He shoved aside a mass of worn charts, battered instruments, cigar butts, ashtrays with statuettes of naked girls in a half-dozen startling poses, comic books, illustrated magazines with sexy pictures, and made a space on the top. He thrust forward a sheet of paper. He picked up a fountain pen, flirted it so that .ink spattered the tangle of junk on his desk, then handed it to Gene. \"Sign on the dotted line.\" Gene picked up the document. It was an ordinary kind of form, an application for employment as a spacehand. third class. The ship was not named, but merely called a cargo boat. This was the paper the Company needed to keep the investigators satisfied that no one was forced to work on the ships against their will Anger blinded him. He didn\\'t take the pen. He just stood looking at the Captain and wondering how to keep himself from being beaten to death. After a long moment of silence the Captain laid the pen down, grinned horribly. He gave a snort. \"It\\'s just a formality. Pm supposed to turn these things over to the authorities, but they never bother us anymore. Sign it later, after you\\'ve learned. You\\'ll be glad to sign, then.\" \"What\\'s my job, Captain?\" \"Captain Jorgens, and don\\'t forget the sir!\" \"Captain Jorgens, sir.\" \"I\\'ll put you with the Chief Engineer. He\\'ll find work for you down in the pile room.\" The Captain laughed a nasty laugh, repeating the last phrase with relish. \"The pile room! There\\'s a place for you, Mr. O\\'Neil. When you decide to sign your papers, we\\'ll get you a job in same other part of this can!\" Gene found his way back to the cabin he had just left. The little guy with the hairy neck was there, leering at the girl. \"Put you in the pile gang didn\\'t he?\" Gene nodded, sat down wearily. \"I want to sleep,\" he said. \"Nuts,\" said the little man. \"I\\'m here to take you to the Chief Engineer. You go on duty in half an hour. Come on!\" Gene got up. He was too sick to argue. Ann looked at him sympathetically, noting his split lips. He managed a grin at her, \"If I never see you again, Ann, it\\'s been nice knowing you, very Bice.\" \\'Til see you, Gene. They\\'ll find us tougher than they bargained for.\" some of the atomic power stations he\\'d seen. Only smaller. There was no heavy concrete shielding, no lead walls. There was shielding around the central pile, and Gene knew that inside it was the hell of atomic chain reaction under the control of the big levers that moved the cadmium bars. There was a steam turbine at one end, and a huge boiler at the other. Gene didn\\'t even try to guess how the pile activated the jets that drove the space ship. Somehow it \"burned\" the water. This pile had been illegal from the first. Obviously some official had been bribed to permit the first use of it on a spaceship. Certainly no one who knew anything about the subject would have allowed human beings to work around a thing like this. Gene\\'s skin crawled and prickled with the energies that saturated the room. Little sparks leaped here and there, off his finger-tips, off his nose. The Chief Engineer was on a metal platform above the machinery level. The face had hair all over it, even on the eyelids. The eyes, popping weirdly, were double. They looked as if second eyes had started growing inside the original ones. They weren\\'t reasonable; they weren\\'t even sane. The look of them made Gene sick, The Engineer shook his head back and forth to focus the awful, mutilated eyes. His voice was infinitely weary, strangely muffled. \"Another sacrifice to Moloch, an\\'s the pity! So they put you down here, as if there was anything to be done? Well, it\\'ll be nice to work with someone who still has his buttons -- as long as they last. Sit down.\" Gene sat down and the metal chair gave him a shock that made him jump. \"I don\\'t know anything about this kind of work.\" The man shrugged, \"Who does? The pile runs itself. Ain\\'t enough of it moves to need much greasing. You ought to be able to find the grease cups -- they\\'re painted red. Fill them, wipe off the dust, and wait. Then do it over again.\" \"What\\'s the score on this bucket?\" \"We\\'re all signed on with a billy to the knob. And kept aboard by a guard system that\\'s pretty near perfect. After awhile the emanations get to our brains and wc don\\'t care anymore. Then we\\'re trusted employees. Only reason I don\\'t blow her loose, it wouldn\\'t do any good.\" He got up, a fragile old body clad in dirty overalls. He beckoned Gene to follow him. He led the way to a periscope arrangement over the shielded pile. Gene peered in. It was like a look into boiling Hell. As Gene stared, the old man talked in his ear. \"Supposed to be perfectly shielded, and maybe they are. But something gets out. I think it happens in the jet assembly. A tiny trickle of high pressure steam crosses the atomic beam just above a pinhole that leads into the jet tube. It\\'s exploded by the beam, exploded into God knows what, and tlte result is your jet. It\\'s a wonderful drive, with plenty of power for the purpose. But I think it forms a strong field of static over the whole shell of the ship, a kind of sphere of reflection that throws the emanations back into the ship from every point. Just my theory, but it explains why you get these physical changes, because that process of reflection giveS a different ray than was observed in the ordinary shielded jet.\" Gene nodded, asked: \"Can I look at the jet assembly?\" \"Ain\\'t no way to look at it! Ids sealed dp to hold in tire expanding gases from that exploded steam. Looking in this periscope is what changed my eyes. Only other place the unshielded emanations could escape is from the jet chamber. Only way they can get back into the ship is by reflection from some ionized layer around the ship. If I could talk to some of those bigbrained birds that developed this drive. I\\'d sure have tilings to say.\" Gene was convinced the old man knew what he was talking about. \"Why don\\'t you try to put your information where it\\'ll do some good? How about the Captain?\" \"He\\'s coocoo.\" The old man slapped the cover back on the periscope, tottered back to his perch on the platform. \"He sure has changed the last two years. Won\\'t listen to reason.\" Gene squatted on the steps, just beneath the old engineer\\'s chair. The old man seemed glad to have someone to talk to. \"It\\'s got us trapped. And it\\'s so well covered up from the people. Old spacers are changed physically, \\' changed mentally. They know they cant go back to normal life, because it\\'s gone too far. They\\'d be freaks. No woman would want a monstrosity around. Besides, it don\\'t stop, even after you leave the ships. God knows what we\" #I look like in the end.\" Gene shivered. \"But you\\'re all grown men! A fight with no chance of winning is better than this! Why do you take it?\" \"Because the mind changes along with the body. It goes dead in some ways, gets more active in others. The personality shifts inside, until you\\'re not sure of yourself, and can\\'t make decisions any more. That\\'s why nobody does anything. Something about those rays destroys the will. Nobody leaves the ships.\" \"I will!\" Gene said confidently. \"When the time comes, I\\'ll go. All Hell can\\'t stop me.\" The old man yawned. \"Hope you do, son. Hope you do. I\\'m going to take me a nap.\" He propped his feet up on the platform rail and in seconds was snoring. Gene clenched his fists, growing despair in his thoughts.  \"Tain\\'t no worse than dying in a war,\" muttered the old man in his sleep. learned. He understood why these men didn\\'t actively resent the deal they were getting. No wonder the secrecy was so effective! The radiations deadened the mind, gave one the feeling of numbness, so that nothing mattered but the next meal, the next movie in the recreation lounge, the next drink of water. Values changed and shifted, and none of them seemed important. The chains that began to bind him were far stronger than steel. The chains were mental deterioration, degeneration, mutation within the very cells of the mind. He knew that now he must tend this monster ft forever, grease and wipe the ugly metal of it, and sit and talk idly to MacNamara, its keeper. He realized it, and didn\\'t know how to care ! The anger and hate came later. The real, abiding anger, and the living hate. At first the numbness, the sudden incomprehensible enormity of what had happened to him, then the anger. Hate churned and ground away inside him, getting stronger by the hour. It all revolved around the Captain who tramped eternally around the corridors bellowing orders, punching with his huge fists. He knew there was more to it; the lying owners of the Company, the bribe-taking officials, the health officers who failed to examine the ships and the men and the ships\\' papers. But somehow it all boiled down to the Captain. Sometimes he was sure he must be crazy  already. Sometimes he would wake up screaming from a nightmare only to find reality more horrible.  V  Then he would go to Ann. Ann wits not the only woman aboard ship. There were three others, and to the crew of twenty imprisoned, enslaved men they represented all beauty, all womanhood. They lived with the men -- as the men -- and nobody cared. Here, so close to the raging elementals of the pile, life itself was elemental. As one of them expressed it to Gene: \"Why worry? We\\'re all sterile from the radioactivity anyway. Or didn\\'t you know?\" She had been on the ship for years, and was covered with a fine fur, like a cat\\'s. Her eyes were wide, placid, empty; an animal\\'s unthinking eyes. Gene prayed Ann would never turn monster before his eyes ; hoped desperately they could get away in time. \"We\\'ve got to fight, Ann,\" he said to her one day. \"We must find a way to get off at the end of the trip, or it will be too late for us to live normal lives. It\\'s then of never. Besides that, we\\'ve got to warn people of what\\'s going on. They think space travel is safe...In time this could effect the whole\\' race. The world must be told, so something can be done.\" Ann\\'s young face showed signs of the strain. The fear of turning into some hideous thing was preying on her mind. She spoke rapidly, her voice breaking a little. \"I\\'ve been talking to several of the crew y the old-timers, trying to get an understanding of why nothing is done. It\\'s this way: when the ships land, guards come aboard. They\\'re posted at the cargo locks and the passenger entrances. The only door aboard the ship that leads to the passenger compartment is in the Captain\\'s cabin, and it\\'s locked from both sides. Even our Captain never meets the passengers. There\\'s only one chance, a mutiny. Then we could open the door, show the passengers.\" \"It wouldn\\'t do any good. When we landed, they\\'d find a way to shut us all up before we got to anybody. They\\'ve had a lot of practice keeping this quiet. They know the answers.\" She stamped a foot angrily. \"It was you who said we had to fight! Now you say it\\'s hopeless!\" Gene leaned against the wall and passed a hand across his eyes. He looked at Ann\\'s flushed beauty and managed a grin. \"Guess I\\'m getting as bad as the rest of them, baby. We\\'ll fight. Sure we\\'ll fight.\" Schwenky was a gigantic Swede. He was the boss freight handler. It was his job to sort the cargo for the next port of call. He would get it into the cargo lock, then seal the doors so nobody would ttfy to smuggle themselves out with the freight. Schwenky was intensely loyal and stupid enough not to understand the real reason behind their imprisonment -- which was why he held his job. No one got by Schwenky. But this time, in Mar sport, something was missing. They\\'d driven the trucks up to the cargo port, unloaded everything, and then compared invoices with the material. They swore some claimed machinery parts were due them. Schwenky swore he\\'d placed them in the cargo lock, and that the truckers were trying to hold up the Company. The Captain allowed the truckers\\' claim and after the ship had blasted off into space, called Schwenky in to bawl him out. They must have gotten really steamed up, because Gene and Frank Maher heard the racket clear down on the next deck where they were cleaning freight out of a sealed compartment for the next stop. Gene and Frank raced up the ladders to the top deck, and Gene found the bi\\'eak he had prayed for. Schwenky holding the Captain against the wall; beating the monstrosity that had once been a man with terrible fists. Gene felt a sudden thrill. In a situation like this you used any weapon you could find. Schwenky was a deadly weapon. Gene laid a hand on Schwenky\\'s massive shoulder. \"Hold it man! You\\'ll kill him!\" Schwenky turned a face, red and popeyed, to Gene. \"The Captain make a mistake. He try to knock Schwenky down. No man do that to Schwenky.\" \"When he comes to, he\\'ll lock you in the brig, put you on bread and water... \" Suddenly Schwenky realized the enormity of his offense. It was obvious from his face that he considered himself already dead. \"Nah, my friend Gene! Now they kill Schwenky. Bad ! But what I do?\" Gene eyed him carefully. \"Put the Captain in the brig, of What else? The \"Lock him up, eh? Good idea! Then we think, you and I, what we do next. Maybe something come to us, eh?\" Gene bent over the Gap tain\\'s body, found the pistol in his hip pocket, put it in his own. He took the ring of keys from the belt. \"Bring him along, Schwenky. If we meet anyone, I\\'ll use this.\" Gene patted the gun. \"I won\\'t let them hurt my friend, Schwenky.\" \"Damn! let them come! I fix them! Don\\'t have to shoot them. I got fists!\" \"I\\'d rather be shot, myself,\" said Gene, watching the ease with which the giant freight handler lifted the huge body of the Captain, tossing it over his shoulder like a sack of stteiw Til go ahead\" said Frank Maher. \"If I run into Perkins, the First, I\\'ll whistle once. If I run into Symonds, the Second, I\\'ll whistle twice. I don\\'t think there\\'s another soul aboard we need worry about. All we got to do is slap the Cap in the brig, round up Perkins and Symonds, and the ship is ours. What worries me, Gene, then what do we do?\" \"It\\'s Schwenky\\' s mutiny,\" grinned Gene. \"Ask him.\" \"Nah!\" said Schwenky hastily. \"I don\\' know. Maybe we just sail on till we find good place, leave ship, go look for job.\" Maher said, \"Me with my \\'lumpy face? And the Chief with hair on his cheekbones and double eyeballs? And Heinie with fingernails growing where his collar button should be? I wonder what we cun do, if T hey got down the first stairwell, but passing along the rather lengthy companionway to the next stairhead, they heard Maher whistle twice. Schwenky .put the Captain down, conked him with one massive fist to make sure he stayed out, then stood there, waiting. The Second came up out of the stairwell, turned and started toward them. Gene put his hand on the gun butt, waiting until he had to pull it. Schwenky said: \"Come here, Mr. Perkins, sir. Look see what has happened!\" The Englishman peered at the shapeless, hairy mass of the unconscious Captain. His face went white. Gene knew he was wondering if he could keep the crew from mutiny without the Captain present to cow them. Perkins straightened, his face a pallid mask in the dimness. \"What happened, Schwenky?\" \"This, Mr. Perkins, sir -- \" said Schwenky. He slapped an open palm against the side of Perkins\\' head. Perkins sprawled full length on the steel deck, but he wasn\\'t out, which surprised Gene. He lay there, staring up at the gigantic Swede, his face half red from the terrible blow, the other half white with the fear in him. His hand was tugging at his side and Gene realized he was after his gun. Gene pulled out his own weapon even as he leaped upon the slim body of the man on the floor. His feet missed the moving arm, the hand came out with a snub-hosed automatic in it. Gene grabbed it, bore down went off, the bullet ri the wali-pMes with a . ut the gun dieting off slugged the man across the head with the barrel of the Captain\\'s gun. Perkins went limp. Maher came up now and grabbed Perkins\\' gun. \"Lead on,\" said Gene. He picked Perkins up and put him over his shoulder. Schwenkv retrieved the  slumbering Captain and they proceeded on their way to the cell on the bottom deck. But the shot had been heard, and from above came the sound of running feet. Gene began to trot, ab most fell down the last flight of stairs, went along the companionway at a run. At the cell door he dropped Perkins, tried four or five keys frantically. One fit. He pulled open the door and Schwenky drove in, kicking the body of Perkins over the sill. The Captain dropped heavily to the deck and Schwenky was out again. Gene was locking the door when he heard the shout from Symonds, running toward them. \"What\\'s going on there, men?\" Schwenky started to amble toward the dark, wiry Second, his big face smiling like that of a simpleton. \"We haf little trouble, Mr. Symonds, sir. Maybe we should call you, but we did not haf time. Everything is all right now. You come see, we explain everything , . \" He made a grab forthe little Second Mate\\'s neck with one big paw. But the Second was wary, ducked quickly, was off. Gene and Maher sprang after him. Gene shouted: \"Stop or I\\'ll fire, Symonds! You\\'re all alone now!\" Gene let one ho t angle off the wall, close beside the fleeing form, but the man didn\\'t stop. Instead he headed for the bridge. Gene realized he could lock himself in, keep them from the ship controls. He could hold out there the rest of the voyage. \"We\\'ve got to stop him ! # Maher close behind, they ran up the stairs on the Second\\'s heels. Up the companionway they pounded, the Second increasing his lead. A door opened ahead of him and Ann O\\'Donnell appeared. Symonds cursed and tried to pass her. Ann deftly slid out one pretty leg and the officer turned a somersault, and brought up against the wall at the foot of the stairs to the upper deck and the bridge. But the Second was too frightened to let a little thing like a fall stop him. He went scrambling up the stairs on all fours. Gene was still too far away, and Ann moved like a streak of light. She sailed through the air in a long dancer\\'s leap and with two bounds was up the stair, ahead of the scrambling, fearstricken officer. \"Out of my way, bitch,\" and Symonds hurled himselftoward Ann. Gene leaped forward, but he needn\\'t have bothered. Ann lifted one of her educated feet, caught the Second under the chin and he came down the stair like a sack of meal. Gene caught his full weight. The two men fell in a scramble of flailing arms and legs, knocking the props out from under Maher, who had started out after them. Just how the mixup might have turned out they were not to know, weight of upon out a scream and Symonds # too crushed a sound. \\' C minutes later came back to conscioushis head resting in Ann O\\'Donnelfs lap while her prodded him here and , looking for broken bones, m dead for sure groaned there nr i i \"You\\'ve just had the wind knocked out of you.

Maybe hell know.\" I He didn\\'t. \"All I know is grease cups \" he reminded Gene. ours later eighteen men and four women gathered together in the recreation room to discuss a lan of action.Everyone had his or er ideas, but after an hour of wrangling, they got nowhere. Finally Gene held up a hand and shouted for silence. \"Let\\'s decide who\\'s boss, follow orders\\' he said. \"If be so bold, how about me?\" \"Yah!\" said Schwenky I what you say. I like you!\" Old MacNamara himself. \"Do nothin ought to stick to the lives of those  to take our places have to guarded pile a W  r anxious would happen now if we gave up!\" Gene spoke up again. \"Let me summarize the position we # re in -- maybe then we can make a better decision.\" \"Go ahead.\" said Ann. The others nodded and fell silent, waiting. Gene cleared his throat. \"The way it looks to me, we\\'ve had a lucky accident in getting control of the ship. So far, we\\'ve  not contacted the passengers. They know nothing of the change that\\'s taken place. As it is, I see no point in contacting them. It might force us to face another mutiny, that of the passengers, who would regard us as what we are, mutineers, and when they found we weren\\'t going to our destination, they\\'d certainly not all take it lying down. Point number one, then, is to ignore the passengers, keep the knowledge of a mutiny from them. \"Now, our real purpose in this mutiny is to expose this whole vicious secret slavery, tell Earth of the danger of the unshielded piles in space ships, destroy the Company\\'s monopoly, and bring about new research which I\\'m sure would eventually overcome the difficulty. Just how are we going to do that? The answer is simple -- we must get back to Earth, and we must get back in a way the Company will not be able to intercept us. As I understand it, this won\\'t be easy. The Company is in complete control of space travel, and they have die ships to knock us out of space before we can get near Earth. Somehow we\\'ve got to win through. Gan we do it by a direct return to Earth? I doubt it. How ever, say we do it. Then where do we go? The government might look upon us as mutineers and thus give the Company a chance to quash the whole affair. \"So we\\'ve got to go directly to the people, who, once they see us, and realize what space travel with these piles means, will demand an explanation with such public feeling even the government can\\'t avoid a showdown. It\\'s the secrecy we must break. Thus, we must land on Earth with the biggest possible splurge of publicity. We\\'ve got to do it so no Company ship can prevent it. \"Then there\\'s this to consider. Most of you would find it a difficult thing to take up a life on. Earth. I know that many of you want to take off for some remote world, and try to live out your lives by yourselves. I say that would be a cowardly thing to do. So, before we decide anything else, I say let\\'s decide here and now that the only thing we will do is go back to Earth.\" One of the most grotesquely deformed of the crew spoke up. \"No woman would ever look at me,\" he said defiantly. \"Children would stare at me and scream in terror. I\\'ve suffered enough. Why should I suffer more?\" The woman in the fine fur got to her feet and walked over to him. She sat down beside him and took his hand in hers. \"I will look at you,\" she said. \"When we get back to Earth, I Will many you and live wifh you -- if you are brave enough to take me there.\" For an instant the crewman ft  stared at her out of his horribly bulging popeyes. then he swallowed hard and clutched her hand fiercely. \"The Devil hinfself will hot keep me from it ! # he said hoarsely. Gene, staring at the man, felt a warm hand slip into his, and he turned to find Ann, \"I think that answers for all of us,\" she said. The room rang with the shouts of approval. Once more Gene began talking. \"All right, then, I\\'ve a plan. First, we\\'ll try to find out how to maneuver this craft. I believe we can persuade one of the Mates to show us the controls without much trouble.\" \"Yah!\" interrupted Schwenky. \"They show!\"... \"We\\'ll set a course for Earth by the sun. We\\'ll come in with the sun at our back, which means we\\'ll have to make a wide circle off the traveled spacelanes, through unknown space, and come in from the direction of the inner planets, which are uninhabited and unvisited. Also, with the sun behind us, we won\\'t be observed from Earth. Then, with all our speed, we\\'ll come in, land at high noon in Chicago, right in front of the offices of the Sentinel , the newspaper for which I work.\" There was a chorus of exclamations. Ann looked at him in amazement. \"You, a newspaperman!\" she gasped. \"Yes. I was sent out by my boss to find out what was behind the secrecy of the space ships. I got shanghaied as a crew member. Now, with your help, maybe I can complete rriy assignment. Once we get to my boss, the show will be over. He\\'ll blast the story wide open \" \"Wonderful!\" shouted Maher. \"Come, Schwenky! We will get Perkins and make him show us how to run the ship!\" Schwenky chortled in glee. \"Yah! We get. By golly, I know that Gene O\\'Neill is good mail! Maybe I get my picture in newspaper?\" Maher stared at him. \"God forbid!\" he said. \"Unless it\\'s in the cbmic section!\" \"Yah!\" agreed Schwenky. \"In comic section!\" crossed Earth\\'s orbit and headed in behind the planet in the plane of the sun, the meteorite hit. It tore a great hole in the passenger side of the ship, and knocked out the port jets. The ship veered crazily under the influence of its lopsided blast, and the crew was hurled against the wall and pinned there as the continuing involuntary maneuver built up acceleration. Gene, who had been in his bunk, was pressed against the wall by a giant hand. Savagely he fought to adjust himself into a more bearable position, then tried to figure out what had happened. Obviously the ship was veering about, out of control.\"Meteorite!\" he gasped. \"We\\'ve been hit.\"   He pulled himself from the bunk, slid along the wall to the ddtsU It was all he could do to open it, but once in the companionway outside he found that he could crawl along one wall, off the floor, in an inching progress. He ma.de it finally to the control room, and forced his body around the door jamb and inside. Against the far wall Maher was plastered, dazed, but conscious. At his feet lay Heinie, his head crushed, obviously dead. \"Cut off the rest of the jets!\" gasped Maher. T can\\'t make it!\" Gene crawled slowly around the room, following the wall, until he could reach the controls, then he pulled the lever that controlled the jet blast. The ship\\'s unnatural veering stopped instantly and both Maher and Gene dropped heavily to the floor. Gene was up first and helped Maher to his feet. Together they turned to the indicators. \"Passenger deck\\'s out!\" said Maher. \"Except for a few compartments. The automatic seals have operated. But there must be somebody left alive in them.\" \"We\\'ve got to get them,\" said Gene. \"But first, we\\'ve got to check up on what damage has been done here, and how many casualties we have.\" \"Heinie\\' s dead,\" said Maher. \"He hit the wall with his head \" Gene shuddered, and deep in his stomach nausea churned. \\'He thought of Ann and his blood froze In his veins. \"You take below decks. IT! go up,\" he said. Ann\\'s cabin was on the deck above. Maher nodded and staggered away. Gene scrambled up the stairwell as fast as he could, and ran down the. corridor. At Ann\\'s door he stopped, turned the knob. The door opened. The room was empty. Suddenly he heard running footsteps, and Ann threw herself into his arms, sobbing. \"Where were you?\" he asked, almost savagely. \"I went to your cabin, to see if you were hurt. What happened to the ship?\" \"Meteorite hit us. Knocked out the passenger deck. Most of the passengers will be dead, but we\\'ve got to go in and rescue the survivors.\" Doors were opening here and there and the crew members able to make it were congregating around them. They went to the recreation room. There Gene counted noses. Five crewmen were missing. Of those present, six men were injured, and one woman exhibited a black eye, accentuating her other abnormalities. The three prisoners were reported unharmed. \"What about the missing men?\" Gene asked. \"Three dead,\" Maher replied, \"two badly hurt. We\\'ll need somebody to look after them.\" \"I\\'ll go,\" volunteered Ann. The woman in fur stepped forward also, and they left the room behind Maher and Schwenky. Gene faced the rest. \"We\\'ve got a real problem now. With a reduced crew, we\\'ll have to finish a trip that would have been tough with an uninjured ship. But first, we\\'ve got to search the passenger deck and remove the survivors. All of you who are able, put on pressure suits and come with me He led the way to the locker containing the pressure suits. Seven men, those who were not too deformed to don the suits, made up the party. Gene led the way to the Captain\\'s stateroom, ordered the door sealed behind them, then opened the only door to the damaged deck. The air rushed out as the door swung open, and suddenly complete silence descended upon them. There would be no more communication between them except for signs. In an hour they had determined the truth. All passengers but one, a woman, had been killed instantly. The woman was unconscious, but suffering only from bruises. It had been necessary, after discovering her unpierced cabin, to return to the deck above and cut through with a torch. When she regained consciousness and saw her rescuers, she screamed. \"That\\'ll give us some idea of how the people back on Earth will receive us\" said Gene. \"If we get there, that is.\" Later, in the control room, Maher and MacNamara gave their report. \"We can make it,\" said Mac  Namara, \"but we\\'ll come in limping like a wounded moose. If any of the Company ships sight us, we\\'ll be a sitting duck. But maybe it will be better that way. This is like war, and some of us must die ...\" His voice trailed off in a mumble. r \"Some of us are dying,\" said Maher. \"But he\\'s right, Gene; we can make it, with luck. We\\'ll not be able to come in fast, nor land in the city, but we\\'ll make it to Earth.\" \"That\\'s enough,\" decided Gene. \"If we can land near Chicago, I think I can manage the rest.\" They turned to the controls, and MacNamara went back to his pile room. Once more the ship limped on. this time directly toward the  # ball of Earth, looming a scant goal. Then tragedy struck again. The cabin on the passenger deck from which they had removed the sole survivor blew its door, and the air on the deck above rushed out through the hole they had burned into the cabin. It had been forgotten, and it meant the lives of three more crew members. Then, as they prepared to bring the ship into the atmosphere, Maher, peering through the telescope, let out a shout. \"Company ship, coming up fast! They\\'re after us!\" Gene leaped to the telescope and peered through. Far to the left, a glowing silver streak in the sky, was the familiar shape of a space ship, growing larger by the minute. Studying it, Gene saw that it was an armed cruiser. \"They\\'ve got wise,\" said Maher. \"I thought they would, when we didn\\'t check in at Io. Probably radioed back to be on the lookout for us.\" \"Call MacNamara,\" said Gene. \"We\\'ve got to see if he can set us down faster. Maybe there\\'s some way to step up that pile \" Maher rushed off, and Ann came in. \"What\\'s up?\" she asked. \"Cruiser after us,\" said Gene, his face grim. \"Looks like we won\\'t get to Chicago unless MacNamara has something up that old sleeve of his.\" Ann went white, and together they waited for the old Engineer. When he came in, Gene gestured to the telescope. \"Take a look \" MacNamara squinted through the eyepiece with his double popeyes. \"Don\\'t see a thing,\" he grumbled. \"Well, it\\'s a Company Cruiser, gunned to the limit. She\\'s going to be near enough to shoot us down in about three hours.\" \"Three hours, you say?\" MacNamara scratched his head. \"How near we to Earth?\" \"You could make it in die lifeboat.\" Gene snorted. \"That Cruiser\\'d shoot down the lifeboat as easy as it will the ship -- a lot easier.\" \"If they can catch you,\" said MacNamara. \"Some of us must die, that the rest may live.\" \"Don\\'t start . that again, Mac,\" said Maher impatiently. \"What we want to know\\' is whether you can soup up that pile so we can beat that Cruiser dovn to Earth?\" \"Not a thing I can do,\" said the Chief Engineer. \"We\\'ve only one set of tubes. Full power would shoot us all over die sky. But I can do something as good\" \"What?\" T The old Engineer considered them through his double eyes. \"The rest of you\\'ll take the lifeboat and make for Earth.  I\\'ll remain here on the ship and shield your flight. I\\'m sure I can hide the little boat for awhile, and then, even with one jet, I think I can delay the cruiser until you get away. Someone\\'s got to make a sacrifice. I\\'m old, and I didn\\'t want any of this to begin with. Maher gasped. \"Mac, you old fool. D\\'ya mind if I apologize for what I just said? But you\\'re right, that\\'s a possible answer. Only I\\'ll be the one to stay.\" \"Do you know how to adjust the pile and the jets to make a weapon out of them?\" asked MacNamara. \"No... began Maher. MacNamara grinned. \"Nor am I going to tell you! So, you see, you can\\'t be the one to stav.\" Maher gripped the old man\\'s hand and pumped it. \"You win \" he said. \"You old... crackpot!\" There was real affection in his voice. \"Then be off with you,\" said the Chief Engineer. \"You\\'ve not a minute to lose. Every man jack of you into the boat, including the Captain and the Mates. I\\'ll not have my ship cluttered up with extra hands that might cramp my style... And turning, the old man made his way back to the pile room, mumbling to himself. Eyes wet, Gene gave the orders to abandon ship, and within thirty minutes every living soul was aboard the lifeboat. MacNamara had finished his work with the pile and was back in the control room, waiting for the lifeboat to cast off. As it did so, he waved, then turned to the controls. f As the lifeboat darted away on its chemical jet engines, they could see the old man maneuvering the big ship so as to keep it ever between them and the Cruiser. An hour later when they were within a hundred thousand miles of Earth, MacNamara sent up a flare denoting surrender. Tensely they watched the distant speck of light that was the ship with MacNamara on , it. Then, around its side came the Company Cruiser, steering in toward it to make the capture. It was scarcely a thousand miles from the disabled ship. Gradually it drew closer, then edged in. Now it was only a few miles away, and at this distance, both specks seemed to merge., \"They got him!\" Maher said. \"Yah!\" Schwenky boomed, disappointment in his voice. \"Me, I should have been the one to stay. I would slap them.\" Suddenly, out in space, a bright flower grew. A flower of incandescent light that blossomed with terrifying rapidity, until it seemed to engulf all space in the area of the two ships. The familiar sphere ploding atom bomb hung there in the heavens an instant, then it was gone. In its place was only a vast cloud of smoke, the dust and scattered atoms that were all that remained of two gigantic space ships. \"He detonated the pile!\" said Gene. \"He turned himself into an atom bomb!\" \"Yah!\" said Schwenky, his voice strangely muted. \"Yah!\" Awkwardly he turned and patted Ann\\'s head as she began to sob. Schwenky proudly, holding the front page of the newspaper up for all to see. \"I have my picture in the paper! Is it not njce?\" Laughing, Ann kissed the big Swede right on the lips, and hugged him, paper and ail. \"It\\'s beautiful, you big Jug!\" she said. \"The handsomest picture I\\'ve ever seen in any paper.\" \"Nah!\" denied Schwenky. \"It is not the handsomest. All of us have our pictures in the paper. We are all very good looking! Not only Schwenky. Is it not so. Gene, my friend?\" Gene grinned at him, and at the others. Maher pounded him on the back, and over the uproar came the voice of the editor of the Sentinel. \"Telephone for Mr. Schwenky!\" Schwenky looked dazed, cocked his big ears at the editor. \"For Schwenky?\" he asked stupidly. \"Telephone? Who would call Schwenky on the telephone?\" \"How do I know?\" said the editor. \"It\\'s some lady... He thrust the phone into the big Swede\\'s hand. \"Lady?\" said Schwenky wonderingly. \"Hello ,... lady... he spoke into the receiver, his booming voice making it rattle. \"The other... \" began Gene, then desisted. \"Never mind, she\\'ll hear you... \"What? You want to marry me? Lady... \" Schwenky\\'s eyes bulged even more, and he roared into the transmitter. \"Lady! You wait! I come!\" He thrust the phone into the editor\\'s hands and made for the door like a lumbering bull. \"Where you going?\" yelled Gene. Schwenky halted, turned with a big grin. \"I go to marry lady. She asked me to become my wife!\" \"Where is she?\" asked Gene. \"Where are you going to meet her?\" Schwenky looked stupidly at the now silent phone. \"By golly! I forget to ask her!\" There was tragedy in his voice. \"Now I never find her!\" Mr The editor laughed. \"Never mind -- you\\'ll get a hundred more proposals before the day\\'s over. You can take your pick!\" Schwenky\\' s eyes opened wide. Then he grinned again. \"Yah!\" he roared.\\' \"I take my pick! She will be beautiful! Yah!\" The chatter of the teletype interrupted him, and the editor turned to watch the tape as it came from the machine. The he began to read: \"Washington. April #. President Walworth has grounded all spaceships and ordered all those enroute to proceed to the nearest port. A Congressional committee has been picked, including top members of the cabinet, to investigate the ships, the atomic drives, and the system of secret slavery among crews. In a statement to the Press, President Walworth said that space travel wall not be resumed until proper shields are developed. But he added that he had been informed by leading physicists that the problem can be solved within a year if sufficient funds were available. Said the President: T will see that the funds are made available!\\' \" The editor dropped the tape and turned to Gene. \"I have one more bit of information, this one direct from the President by phone. He has asked me to inform you that he has appointed you new head of that?\" \"Federal Agency for Space Travel,\" grinned the editor. \"And congratulations. I hate to lose a good reporter, but maybe you\\'ll be back after you finish in Washington -- at a substantial increase in salary.\" Gene grinned back. \"Maybe I will,\" he said. \"And Fll need the money.\" He put an arm around Ann and drew her to him. \"Tw\\'o can\\'t live as ckeap as one, you know.\" is a very personable young man who lives in P.O. Box #, he has labored mightily and thanklessly to evolve and create the \"\\'Science Fiction News Letter.\" This, according to Bob\\'s letterhead is \"the leading newspaper of the science fiction world.\" The first item in the oldest issue of this newsletter we have at hand (Feb. #) reads: slick fantasy and scific magazine appear soon. Details scarce and Mag will follow gen of Time .

The two items quoted are hot necessarily representative of # the broader content of Bob TuckeEs newsletter. But Bob Tucker is certainly representative of that broad and interesting brotherhood -- the science-fiction fan clubs. Even the moreso because his newsletter rep resents no single club, but caters to the many hundreds of them all over the world. An examination of the letter shows it to be neatly almost professionally done. But more tit ah this, it shows the heart and sou the work and sweat that goes into it. Bob\\'s circulation has risen from a handful of giveaways in a paid circulation in # copies. This rise is live of two factors public interest in and Tucker\\'s amazin age, or maybe plain ness. Bob Tucker is by any means, which has no hairs in his # flash iiifor pr ;tion editors and who will in the next F. There is also Captain , whose very jwsletter circulates about # hout the world. And are no doubt others. , at this points two. questions arise in the mind of the casual non-letter-writing reader of science-fiction, who makes up, of \\'bourse, the vast bulk of the field\\'s paid circulation. First, why do these amateur newsmen do it? Why does Bob Tucker beat out his brains year after year in this strange manner? Profit? We are sure this is not the case. Tucker\\'s letter is issued bimonthly and sells for #c a copy. He could make more money \\'redecorating old bird houses. Vanity? Certainly not in the case of Wilson Tucker, who has written six novels -- five of which are oddly enough, ive yarns and only one a science-fiction story -- since and must be far more widely known for his fiction than his stf Personal satisfacopinion, is it. And for us, the second reader.: fan clubs? Pi writers in various Q. l which may enomenon of sciy see no the movehi  o. e ment unless to movie star stamp collectors segment of hobbyists In short, scienceto be a hobby with ing of sane, healthy-mindc who band the natural manner to cuss their mutual interests. In fact the principle error here is ir the term \"science-fiction\" to their particular field. While one the major cohesive forces relative to this hobby is the-\\' professional science-fiction magazine, many of the fen are thoroughly at home with the dry-as-dust higher mathematics, abstract equations, and technical data which have no place in magazines dedicated to pure entertainment and seldom appear there. An item noted in Tucker\\'s newsletter informed us that a. stf fan wrote to a fairly well-known scientist named Einstein, received a reply, and that the fan\\'s local club spent entire session digesting that reply.  said about the fringe\" of stf fandom. B doubt, such a fringe exist \" w a point that the Post ties last year banned a f; the mails, exists in almost enthusiasm, fanatic is far say the baseba vet to hear ff  Ksjt m a on V ing to start. Yet this \"phenomenon\" can be observed unfailingly every year in front of a world series stadium. In case the reader may interpret the foregoing as IF\\'s invitation to the fan clubs into a mutual admiration society, it\\'s not true, and we ask Bob Tucker and his clansmen to read further. As an individual, we admire them very much, but as editor of IF, a magazine dedicated to entertainment and thence to a publisher\\'s profit, we can only quote the able Sam Merwin who with the following comment in the October \\'# I issue of that magazine : \",... fans as such make up a very small percentage of our net paid circulation . The magazine is achy a much less actively zealous and vociferous readership. Thus we have given the fans space in the deliberate hope and intention of making their antics entertaining to at least a fair proportion of the larger, less-fannish readership We did not see the foregoing reported in Tuckers newsletter. An oversight no doubt. But Bob certainly knows that Sam Merwin is a man who -- by his own admission -- considered \"the trading of reasonably ingenious insults a delightful pastime\". Therefore we think we could, with Sam\\'s consent, substitute \"their affairs interesting\" for \"their antics entertaining\" in the above quotation. And with the substitution we\\'ve probably quoted from Sam, the policy of ninety-nine percent of the professional stf mag editors, although few of them have exhibited either Sam\\'s courage or his desire to give up editing. Frankly, we don\\'t think the fans need the pro mags as much as they appear to. We feel that if all paper supplies were suddenly needed to make blotters for the Pentagon and the pro mags thus ceased to be. Bob Tucker and his sciencefiction fans would go merrily on their way, getting together to discuss atom bombs, guided projectiles, space platforms and other things far beyond the layman\\'s ken.

The only major difference was that there were no remains under the evenly spaced stones. There was some doubt that it had been a cemetery. But the guide announced it as one. And that announcement as the bus came to a stop Had a pronounced effect on Herb. He began his Buttery elbow movements again and looked afound at Dotty with a triumphant smile. I moved up quickly to keep him in earshot. He protested when George insisted on taking camera shots, then gave in and cooperated in order to get it over with. Finally George snapped his camera shut. Herb mumbled something to Dotty that I didn\\'t catch, and started down one of the lanes between rows of stones as though headed for a definite goal. I ebtildrf t very well follow aftef they left the main group. It would have been obvious. Instead, I veered off to one side, gambling that when they reached their destination I would be able to read their lips. I got well away from stragglers and took out my mifrosebpe, pointing if off in the distance and swinging the objective lens around until it centered on them. I was lucky. They were facing in my direction. \"It isn\\'t a cemetery,\" Herb was saying with emphatic motions of his hands. \"It was a parking area, and this stone was where I parked my air sled. I can remember it as though it were yesterday.\" . I had to admire the man\\'s subconscious. It was a remarkably shrewd guess. The experts wouldn\\'t play along with it, but they would probably never be able to prove him wrong on that count. But Dotty was arguing with him. \"How can you prove it was a parking area?\" Her eyes roamed over the Jarge field with its regularly spaced stones. \"It certainly looks impractical for a parking lot.\" \"Just the same, that\\'s what it was. I wish I had a shovel here. I seem to remember burying something near my stone. If I could find that it would prove I really remember.\" \"Why don\\'t you forget it?\" Dotty pleaded. \"After all, even if it were true, hat docs it matter now ? # \"It matters to me. Ever since we arrived here I\\'ve seen familiar things. Too familiar to be coincidence. I never felt this way before. I always considered reincarnation as ancient superstitious belief, just like everyone else. But not any more. I know.

Herb and Dotty managed to sit together and I got a place right behind them where I could eavesdrop. Rut they sat in silence. The bus had left the ancient city behind, to head out over the desert toward one of the few structures on Mars which had withstood the ravages of time without crumbling.

The guard caught my meamfig, edged over to his partner, and soon both men were warned that Herb was to be closely watched. I felt better, knowing that a couple of others knew about him. Maybe it would have been smarter to have taken him in .custody right then. But it would have meant a scene. The procedure of the tour was for the guide to do all the talking, leading the procession through the roped off parts of the dome, while the two guards followed along behind to make sure no stragglers got left.

And I hope nobody gets killed. They should have spotted this Herb guy and not let him come here at all. I suspect they did spot him, and let him come to conduct another of their damned experiments. They don\\'t want to leave well enough alone.\" We were outside now. No one was around. The sun was just beginning to set, and the instant it disappeared the night would be pitch-black. Even if one of the moons was out  \"We\\'ll be watching on the standard C.L band,\" Steve assured me. \"They\\'re at the temple right now, waiting for it to get dark.\" He grinned. \"Good luck.\" There was a mixture of genuineness, half mctckery, and worry in his voice. At the temple ruins I found them easily enough and took the simplest course. I walked right up to them. \"Hello,\" I said. \"I thought I\\'d find you here. I want to go along with you. I\\'m interested.\" \"What do you mean?\" Herb was hostile and suspicious. \"You remember me. I was on the tour this afternoon. I accidentally overheard you. It would he something if reincarnation could be proven.\" \"Do you believe in reincarnation?\" # I frowned as though being cautious. \"I don\\'t know.\" Then I put a disarming grin on my lips. \"Since believing in it is legally classified as insanity, for the records, no.\" It was a nice statement. It could imply that I did, and Herb took that implication. He accepted me. Dotty was different. \"How do you know he isn\\'t an agent?\" she asked Herb uneasily. \"If I am. the fat\\'s in the fire,\" I told her. \"but wouldn\\'t I be locking him up?\" This quieted, but didn\\'t satisfy her. \"Anyway,\" I said, \"if you can dig up something that you remember burying, an extra witness won\\'t do any harm. That\\'s what you\\'re after, isn\\'t it? Proof that will end the last bit of doubt?\" \"That\\'s right,\" Herb said. \"And you can help me dig.\" \"Okay then,\" I said. And it was settled. We introduced ourselves, then lapsed into silence while we waited for the sun to set. It wasn\\'t long. a cemetery than ever in the eerie glow of black light pencils as we made our way along a row of stone markers. Herb strode purposefully. Dotty stuck close to him, still a little suspicious of me. I trailed half a step behind. Finally Herb stopped beside one of the markers. \"This is it,\" he said softly. I blinked at the marker then t atHerb. It wasn\\'t the one he had singled out in the afternoon. Was he mixed up? If he was he was a good actor. He took out one of the dinner knives and squatted down and started to probe the soil, loosening it so that it could be scraped out by hand. I watched him dig. Part of the time I helped him. Wc found nothing. After a reasonable amount of this Herb stood up with a resigned sigh. \"Guess i was wrong, I \" he said. \"Poor Herby,\" Dotty said. \"Yeah, poor Herby,\" Herb said with every appearance of tiredness and defeat. \"But -- that\\'s that. Sorry to have gotten you all excited about nothing, Joe. Guess it was too much to expect anything.\" He turned to Dotty. \"As long as we\\'re out here, let\\'s take a walk by ourselves. Huh?\" That was as obvious a cue as I had ever been handed. Neat. I was confronted with the alternatives of scramming or calling him a liar. \"Guess I might as well go back to the hotel,\" I said  cheerfully. \"See you in the morning.\" I headed back the way we had corne until I was sure they couldn\\'t hear me or see me with their black light pencils. Then, ducking down next to a marker I waited. After a couple of minutes I heard cautious foosteps. TPs me, joe -- Steve.\" \"Good,\" I grunted. \"What are they doing now? They gave me the brush-off.\" \"I got the play,\" Steve said. \"Slick. Should we close in now, or wait?\" \"I think I\\'ll play my part a lit- tie fur ther. Don\\'t want G.I. to think we\\'re timid.\" \"Okay,\" Steve said. \"The next funeral we attend may be our own.\" \"Yeah \" I said. \"It might.\" I moved into the darkness, not using my black light pencil, but keeping my sensitized glasses on so I could see Herb\\'s if I got close enough. I reached the spot where we had done the digging. I hesitated, then kept on, toward the spot where Herb and Dotty had been so engrossed that afternoon. In my mind\\'s eye I knew exactly where it was. My hands explored ahead of me, searching out each stone marker along my path, dinging to it as I passed it, and slipping off as I went on to the next. They were my only contact with reality in this total blackness. I was thinking, too. I was thinking of what Herb had said about this being a parking area for airsleds back before the earliest known records of man on Earth when this  f city was alive. He was probably right about it at that. Analysis had shown the presence of copper and aluminum in the top surface of some of the markers that could only be accounted for by some metallic object setting atop each one long ago, and remaining so that molecular and atomic creep could set in, carrying such atoms deep into the surface crystals of the stone. And I was wondering what it was he hoped to dig up. If it were f some sort of weapon it probably wouldn\\'t work after all this time. It couldn\\'t! Or could it? A few things had been pieced together about the ancient Martian civilization. Not much, but enough to be sure that they knew afew things we had never discovered. They had been masters at creating machines with no moving parts. The electronic devices we had found had proven they knew far more about V.H.F. than wc did. I could see what G.l. was aiming at now. We might not even recognize what Herb was searching for. It would be better to let him find it, and get it from him before he could use it. If it was a weapon. \\'And it probably was a weapon. I was pretty sure his main objective was hidden in the wall in the dome, and that tills thing in the cemetery was something that would help him get to that abjective. My thoughts came back to my surroundings. I was less than a dozen feet from where Herb and Dotty should be. I stopped. There was no trace of black light. I held xnf breath and listened. And I heard the faint scraping of the knife against stone.  standard C.I. infrascope so that I could see. Steve probably knew more of what was going on than I did. I had counted on watching Herb by his own black light pencil, and he was working in darkness. Carefully I stole forward, inch by slow inch, my ears tuned for. the faintest significant sound such as a grunt of satisfaction that would tell of finding what he was digging for. me, thoughts about the latest discoveries in disintegration frequencies, thoughts about how little we knew of that ancient Martian civilization. But also I was figuring what Herb would do. He would find the object he was digging for. Unwittingly he would grunt his triumph. Dotty might forget his strict warnings to be quiet, and say something. Regardless of that, he would stand up slowly, fondling what he had found, remembering what it was and how it worked. There would be a few seconds before it would become a weapon in his hands, seconds that I had to make the most use of, and be ready for. c Uh!\" It was the triumphant grunt I had known would come. Sudden panic made me cast aside whatever vague plan of action I had had. I turned on my pencil, bathing the two in its black light. At the same time I said, \"I thought it was a scheme to get rid of me.\" It was the element of surprise that saved me. A still picture of the scene the black light disclosed etched itself into my mind. There was an object in Herb\\'s hand. A strange, meaningless object, dirty, yet with definite form. It was cradled in his hand like a weapon. It was pointed almost at me. I dropped my pencil and went in low, diving for his legs. I felt the air crackle where I had just stood. As my antis encircled his legs I heard thunder exploding nearby. Training has its advantages. The moment I felt contact with Herb that training took over. I jerked and rolled in a movement calculated to throw him to the ground face down, the motion ending in a backbreaker hold. But only a part of my mind was concerned with that. The other part was frozen with horror. Approximately a half acre of the cemetery was glowing. I saw Steve in the center of it with Herb\\'s weapon pointing his way. The very inertia of matter held Steve together for that brief instant, then he was falling apart, melting and evaporating at the same time, just like the stone markers and the ground around him. I had the thing away from him suddenly, and I wondered what to do next. Running footsteps gave me the answer. It was other C.I. agents closing in. Seconds later they had Herb under control. Dotty was wringing her hands and crying. Me, I was holding the tiling, afraid to let go of it and afraid to keep on holding it. But as the seconds passed without it exploding into destructive action again I began to let myself think I might live a while longer. The area of destruction was molten now. Its heat was like that of an open blast furnace. We skirted it and headed toward the road, lights in the distance telling us that cars were on the way to get us, I saw Dotty stumble. I took her arm. , She looked up at me, recognized me in the light from the glowing pool of bubbling lava, and tried to pull away. \"Take it easy,\" I said gruffly. c Tm your friend. Maybe the only friend you\\'ve got here.\" Her look told me she didn\\'t bed r lieve me, but she didn\\'t pull away any more. We walked along, and after a moment she seemed to struggle up out of her mental paralysis. \"Herb was right!\" she said in a low, wondering tone. \"He really did remember.\" \"Itwas plain coincidence,\" I said sharply, \"and don\\'t ever let yourself think differently. He\\'s insane. It\\'s a recognized form of insanity. He\\'ll be sent to a good mental hospital, and in a year or two he\\'ll come out good as new.\" \"Coincidence?\" she echoed. Then she laughed. It was mirth that drifted quickly into hysterical hopelessness. I dug my fingers into her flesh until the pain brought her to her senses. \"Coincidence,\" I said. \"Nothing more. I\\'ve seen seventeen cases just like his. How else did I spot him? I recognized the type. None of the others found what they rationalized themselves into thinking they remembered from the time they were Martians. Eventually one of them would stumble onto something. That\\'s coincidence. Not incarnated memory.\" She turned her head and blinked at me. I nodded grimly. \"I\\'m an agent,\" I said. \"I go out on the tours for one purpose only -- to spot psychos and make sure they don\\'t get out of control You\\'d he surprised how many there are. Some of them, like your husband, probably show no sign of instability until they get here. They look around at the evidence of a civilization that existed before homo sapiens had evolved on the Earth, and it thtows them. If you want to understand more about it read the medical books. They get irrational pre-memories. They look at something and the idea of familiarity associates with the new impression. They look around a corner and see something, and build up the conviction that they had consciously known what was there before they looked around the corner.\" I felt that I was making headway with her. I wanted to. I had to. I \"You -- you say there were others, and they didn\\'t find anything?\" she said. She was groping for something logical to grasp. I had to give bet that something. \"That\\'s right,\" I said. \"And the law of averages said that someday someone would uncover something that\\'s been missed.\" She was nodding slowly now, accepting what I was saying. It was authoritative. She would find com firm a,t ion in authoritative books. If she wanted to pursue the subject she would find plenty of evidence, real evidence, to support it. It is a common form of insanity. It was important that she believe that. We reached the road. C.I. had been prepared. There was a car to take her back to the hotel, a stationwagon for Herb who was now very, submissive and somewhat dazed, and a third car for me and the Science Building ba.seineiit, laying the thing on a wooden table, very gently. It seemed solid, each integral part of its form being of a different metal. None of the men watching me lay it down discounted the danger it contained. They knew too much about how shape and dimension can affect the electronic properties of metal. They knew the thing probably didn\\'t contain an erg of power of its own, but probably triggered and directed the release of cosmic energies as yet unknown to them. They stared at it. One of them reached out to touch it, then slowly drew his finger back. I could see the decision crystallizing in their minds behind their serious eyes. This thing would go with the other strange and incomprehensible machines locked in vaults in a concrete building far out oh the Martian desert away from the tourist trails of this dead planet. It would remain there until the day when human science advanced far enough to understand it. \"What about the wall in the dome?\" I asked. \"They roped it off. They\\'re afraid of it.\" \"Did you convince his wife he\\'s insane ? # one of the science staff asked. I nodded. \"I used the same old line. Told her there were dozens like him, and the law of averages made it certain at least one of diem would find something.\" He nodded, grinned without humor. \"How we love to lie.\" I turned awav. There was a bitter taste in my mouth from all the lies Pd told -- all the bilge. But I knew the truth, too. I was as sure of that as I was of anything. It wasn\\'t insanity, of course. And it wasn\\'t reincarnation. It seemed to be, because the mind has a habit of possessing for its very own anything that enters it. The truth of the matter was that somehow, in some incomprehensible way, the Martians were still with us. They hated us and they knew how to use our weak ones. The old Martians -- and their science.\\' I took a last look at the weapon lying on the table, then left the room and climbed the stairs to the first floor, I walked down the silent, empty hall to the exit and out into the night. I let my eyes roam the blackness Aof the lifeless Martian desert. With an effort I pulled them away and fixed them on the warmth, the human warmth, beckoning from the hotel. I started walking toward that bit of comfort, and as I walked the eternal question that haunted all of us in C.I, hovered in the background of my thoughts. Would we be able to contain the Martiaps until we understood the terrible machines they had left as a deadly heritage? Tonight we almost hadn\\'t...

Should your enemy be infringing on your trade, you do not destroy him utterly. You just try to break him down to your size, or a little beiow. You therefore not only make his markets open to you, but you make him one of your markets.

You don\\'t wash it right off the map, for if it will give him an advantage, it will give you one also -- no matter how many excuses of liberation are made. That liberation yarn was one of Hitler\\'s most-played records, and Joe is running him pretty close! In fairness, it must be admitted that we have our own version of the same story. It follows that internal use of the atom-bomb, except for race suicide, is not likely -- when everyone can use it. And it is probable that most of the leading figures in today\\'s scene could put on a very nice display of atomic fireworks. Each race, creed, or nation, does not desire to . utterly destroy their enemies. They just desire an advantage -- economic -- over the rest. No advantage can be had when the others cease to exist. Although it may be nice politics to demand the use of the atom-bomb when you are not in favour of the present government, or administration is not likely that such demands are made seriously -- except in the public eye. If it were not that the public thought the use of the atom-bomb would be a decisive factor, the opposition would equally likely be expressing a strong desire that the government should refrain from its use. is doubtless considered fallacious by many of my readers -- tends to me to prove the use of the atom-bomb and the planet-smasher improbable in space-war.

Frankly, you may consider this editorial to be an iniquitous vilification of mankind. It is not meant to be. It is intended to show that man, in the main, does things because he hopes to get something out of it. You get. very little out of total devastation, if you are anywhere near the norm.

The fusion-type we expect to be far \\'worse. I do not expect them to be used to any great extent in the future -- and I base my hope and expectation on man\\'s very obvious cupidity!

The old saying should be, \"Science makes strange bedfellows! Biologists have for a long time been interested in the phenomenon of natural phosphorescence as exhibited by fireflies, deep-sea creatures and small animalcules found in fresh water. The mechanism all three types of life employ to change chemical energy into visible light is marvellously efficient. Practically no energy is lost in heat -- merely a fraction f one percent -- the rest appearing as useful light. One of the major objectives of the study of phosphorescence in fireflies was the acquisition of knowledge of the mechanism in order to improve upon the efficiency of fluorescent lamps and glow tubes. This study is still going on. But what is unique is that the scientists concerned are beginning to suspect that there is a link between the way phosphorescence occurs in living things and the way human muscles are triggered into action! Imagine the strange connection between these two (putatively) unrelated phenomena! It made in one branch of science will apply to another, entirely dissimilar, field. The study of the way the muscles act is of fundamental importance to anyone desiring any understanding of the life processes at all. Scientists have so far begun to get the glimmer of an idea as to how nerve actions are basically electrical, but the step from nerve impulse to muscle reaction has been a stumbling block for a long time. Now it appears that the study of fireflies is likely to suggest a lead to the right path. Insect World Can\\'t Win T hat grimly poetic person who had \"the insect crawling out of the eye-socket of the skull Of the last man on Earth\\' will have to change his tune soon. In the never-ending war between men and insects, it appears at last as though man is to get the upper hand. The insect world has countless numbers of soldiers, but the human world has brains. There is a famous laboratory in California devoted to one subjectinsects! It is small and underofteh happens that a discovery staffed, but it is efficient, and froth it have come a number of discoveries that will eventually influence all of our lives. Few pe\\'ople realize the destructiveness of insect pests. damage are done each year by insects to crops, textiles, even metals. And until the Berkeley Laboratory started a truly scientific campaign, all the chemical agents in the world were able to do no more than check their ravages. The Berkeley Laboratory is dedicated to the study of insect diseases. Insects, even as you and I, have a ferocious enemy in fungi aqd bacterial destroyers. Farmers, agronomists and scientists from all over the world have sent dead insects to Berkeley to determine what killed them. Frequently the lab is able to pinpoint the killer and very often it turns out to be a bacterium of some type or another. Fortunately the bacterial diseases that seem to destroy insects are not harmful to humans or animals -- and vice versa. This naturally led the lab men to consider wiping out insect pests with BW -- bacterial warfare. They first fought the alfalfa caterpillar with a filterable virus suspended in water and sprayed from an airplane. The results wereperfect and the caterpillars were wiped out in one fell swoop. Subsequent work has shown that viruses of various types are even more effective than bactericidal componds and, as a consequence, the electron microscope, the only medium through which viruses can be seen, is in constant use. Large varieties of viral substances have been discovered which are able to deplete the insect world, and right now a planned program is in progress, designed to practically label some virus as a destroyer for some insect type, definitely and specifically. The success of this program will be a great boon to farmers, beekeepers, plant and animal breeders, and even to householders. While in reality the threat of insect domination has always been very slight, tlie actual damage done by the creatures has been formidable. Chemicals have limited application and the best bet would seem to be to fight living fire with living fire -- use harmless viruses to combat fearful insects. Science is gradually turning from the manipulation of the physical environment, the inorganic, to the organic. In the biological world rather than the physical are the greatest chances for new and extreme advances. And BW against insects is one of the outstanding new victories ! Gassy Old Universe W hen you think of \"deep space # , of the regions between the remotest stars and galaxies, you think of frightening emptiness, of sheer nothingness, awesome in its lack of matter. This is not exactly the case. So-called \"empty space # is actually filled almost uniformly with vast amounts of plain old hydrogen gas. Near stars this gas is ionized, electrically\\' charged, and can be detected by ordinary telescopic and spectroscopic. observation. But neutral, un charged hydrogen cannot be de tec ted this way. It took the new science of \"radio astronomy to show up the startling amounts of hydrogen present everywhere. First, neutral hydrogen makes its presence known by the unusual fact that every once in a while the electron spin of a single atom of .hydrogen will be completely reversed, and thus it will send out a feeble pulse of radiation -- not visible light, but the subtler radiation of familiar radio waves. Because this pulse is exceedingly weak, and because it occurs with such rarity in the life of a single hydrogen atom, there would be no hope at all of ever detecting it if it were not for the astounding fact that hydrogen is abundant beyond all expectation, m In. a universe measured in hundiameter, it is known that there is approximately one atom of hydrogen for every\\' cubic centimeter of space! This fantastic density explains why radio astronomy in this region works. Rarely does a single hydrogen atom pulse out a blast of radiation, but when countless numbers of atoms are involved, they all add up to an appreciable amount of radiation. Huge receptive directional antennas poke their grotesque shapes into the sky and, with highly sensitive fingers, pick up the twentyone-centimeter radiation that touches their sensitivity. Radio astronomy is now able to make charts and graphs of the radiation distribution. What it means is another matter. What part it plays in the structure of the universe is not fully known but, as has been mentioned before, it is very\\' likely that these enormous numbers of hydrogen atoms provide the fuel for warming the stars, and serve as a vast \"coalpile\" for the stellar furnaces. It is this discovery which leads scientists to think that the universe is not dying, but rather is in a continual state of creative flux, renewing itself and regenerating itself without end. Of course much more will be learned of these things as soon as Man can get out of the hampering blanket of air that interferes with such research and analysis. A Lunar observatory would be the thing that the average radio astronomer would sell his soul for for, without a three-hundredmile blanket of air to soak off the radio Waves before they touch his antenna he\\'d be able to tell a great deal more about what is happening away ! Architecture -- # jT pie are just emerging the Dark Ages! That is a little strong and exaggerated, but it must be remembered that, a mere twenty years ago, the height of architectural style was the imitation of Gothic horrors, or the duplication of the \"California-Spanish # bungalow! Fortunately there has been a widespread increase in good taste stimulated by the superb desi; are cn # # f  \\' beauty and utility without being imitative. , The use of materials such as glass and new synthetic media along with stainless metals and the combining of such structures into a natural relationship with their surroundings lead us to suspect that here is a glowing future in store for architecture. We can\\'t extrapolate architectural designs to the year # but we can certainly visualize the trend they are taking and from that deduce that certain principles will be applied by future architects. The spreading-out of communities is a certainty. People will want then, as now,to take advantage of space and mobility. The skyscraper (which is now slowly dying as an architectural style) may have a new lease on life through the development of the helicopter and the wider use  of flying and moving in three dimensions which will be a surety of the time. As far as materials go, we can only suggest that # will have many as yet undreamed of by us. For example, it is almost a certainty that glass piping will be as common then as are iron and copper now. Many automatic machines just suggested now will be in use in both country life and city life. We may get some minor glimpse of what the future will be like by examining certain fine specimens of contemporary Californian architecture in which full use is made of the idea of relating outdoors to indoors in one complete \"living-unit\". People living in places like these are in harmony with their environment. Nature and Man have combined forces. The year # will see plenty of that, for by then Nature will have been completely tamed and function and aesthetics will be one. -- Charles Recour T he Amazing T rue Story of the Artist W bo Bilked World Art Authorities van Mcegeren, a master artist who, by artful completely fooling some of the world\\'s great art experts!...

Thinking in this vein, it occurred to us that a writer\\'s correspondence concerning a current brain-child might throw at least a dim light on the subject. So here\\'s a peek at some author-letters the postman brought us: Take the note we received from Ted Sturgeon who wrote \"Never Underestimate.\" A story, incidentally, which has already been snapped up for a coming anthology. Ted writes: \"The basic idea for this storv was an extension of known ideas -- extrapolation -- the choice of a solidly based scientific or social phenomena and a series of human narratives about their development. The electric motor evolves into the cyclotron which, logically, should produce an electron accelerator which operates in a straight line instead of a circle. Which is, of course, a driv for a space ship. Analytical chemistry has succeeded in synthesizing proteins, which logically leads to the creation of life in the laboratory and the evolution of man-made species suited to settle the outer planets.\"  (The Hell Ship) Palmer has to say about it : \"Here it is. I think you will like it... \"Keep every story tense with action and human interest and good characters the reader can believe in and you will keep him on the edge of his chair and safely in your hands, as a customer. He wants thrills and excitement. Strange things. Other worlds.\" Thus writes one of the acknowledged masters in the field. And so well put that we arc allowing Ray\\'s Howard Browne, whose Twelve Times Zero left us a trifle breathless, wrote: \"I\\'ve always wanted to put a modern cop into a situation whereby he is forced to cope with pure science-fiction with only his wits and native shrewdness to fall back on. I\\'ll start the story immediately and Til be just as interested as anyone else in finding out what happens to him \" Incidentally, the conversation from which we quoted iit our editorial came  at a later date after Howard\\'s plot was prfcttv well formed. The Old Martians, Rog wrote: \"I hope you\\'ll like this one, Paul. It\\'s somewhat of an experiment. I tried to do a problemstory with three possible solutions, any one of which the reader may take as his town. I hope I succeeded.

A chat with the editor... ly called to my attention in which it was concluded that people\\' who can\\'t get up in the morning, aren\\'t necessarily lazy. I hailed the study with much personal gratification because I have always found it difficult to rise and shine with the morning sun. In fact, I am such a difficult case that I can quote ihy wife as follows: \"Junior, it\\'s time for breakfast. Go up and lead your father down the stairs lest he fall and break his neck.\" \"Junior, show your father where his grapefruit is before he starves to death.\" After breakfast, I am always the last one up from the table, I sit thinking of all the logical reasons why I should drop dead, until my wife says, \"Wake up and go to work, stupid, or you\\'ll find your name scratched off the payroll.\" This dire possibility is usually effective, and I drag myself to the office, hoping the place has burned down. A round noon, things get better. I begin to breathe. My heart starts fluttering and gradually assumes an even, steady beat. By midafternoon I am in pretty good shape, and at quitting time, a no more bright nor alert individual can be found for miles around. Life becomes a great adventure; living a joy. About midnight, my peak of efficiency is reached. Then, around three A.M., comes a cry from the bedroom: \"Get in here and get to bed, you nighthawk. You must have been born backwards.\" This accusation has always made me cringe. The onus of being a misfit has not been taken lightly. But now, along comes this blessed report, telling me I am not alone -- that there is a great suffering fraternity of which I have unknowingly been a member. people. Those who wake up early in the morning at the peak of their efficiency and run down gradually until bedtime. And their exact opposites, who start in low gear, advance to second, and come finally into high with every brain cell popping. In truth, the members of this unhappy clan are out of step with everyone else. But it is not a result of laziness nor habit. It has to do with the structure of their genes, and is as inherent as traits of disposition -- as Impossible to change as a cowlick -- as deeply rooted as a tendency toward baldness. The scientific report states that persons of this type should reverse their living cycle -- arise at sunset, when their efficiency is at its peak; retire when everyone else is going to work. Unfortunately the economic scheme forbids this to most of us. There aren\\'t enough night jobs to go around, and those of us who commute would always find the trains running in the wrong direction. B ut science -- and not fiction- has come to our rescue. We aren\\'t lazy and shiftless. We\\'re just backwards, and we must wipe the stain from our good names. Sq arise. Children of the Night!

When Ralph brought it in I took one look at it and got out the office bottle -- coke of course. We drank to the masterpiece and then my troubles started. With H. G. Wells not available, to whom could I assign the writing of the lead novel? A name flashed automatically. Milton Lesser, that dynamic young man with the magic typewriter. Milt arrived in response to \\' a phone call and I showed him the cover. He said, \"Gosh!\" \"I\\'d like a twenty-five thousand word novel that will do it justice.\" \"What\\'s your idea plotwise?\" \"You\\'re the writer, not I.\" \"But if it\\'s a stinker it bounces,\" he mused. \"How true.\" Milt went home and phoned that evening. \"How do you like Tangle In The Sky?\\' \" \"It listens fine. Swell title.\" Milt stopped coming around for some weeks. Then one day he wandered in with a manuscript. I made a noise like an editor and asked, \"Any rubber in it?\" He grinned like a cat right after dinner and stalked out, leaving the manuscript in my hands. A couple of hours later I called him and said, \"You forgot your check, genius. Want me to mail it?\" I had just finished reading one of the best plotted, smoothest written, ably done space yarns anyone ever handed me. comment on the Ray Palmer article in this issue. It was one of the toughest jobs ever to come my way. Even the more so because Ray is one of my best friends, and th article had to be, above all, entirely objective. Did you ever try to write objectively about one of your best friends? It\\'s not easy. But Ray is \"copy\" and the article was screaming to be written. And now that it\\'s in print I can\\'t even call Ray and say, \"I was only fooling; chum.\" Because I wasn\\'t. mail and how it was tossed at me in one great big lump.

Somehow big man might have been all of his scowl seemed as fierce as the them wrapped into one, Steve head of the Venusian swamptiger thought wryly, and there were a lot mounted on the wall behind him, of trophies. and there was something about his He was the famous Brody Carquick-darting eyes which reminded mical, and rumor had it he was the many richly mounted heads. \"So you\\'re fresh out of school with a degree in Extra-terrestrial zoology\\' Carmical grumbled. \"Am I supposed to turn cartwheels?\" Steve cleared his throat. \"The Placement Service thought you might have a job -- \" \"I do, I do. That doesn\\'t mean any young pup who comes along can fill it. Ever been off the Earth, Mr. Stedman?\" \"No.\" \"Ever been off the North American continent?\" \"No.\" \"But you want to go galavanting around the Solar System in search of big game. Tell me -- do you think they have a Harvard club on every stinking satellite you\\'ll visit? Do you think you can eat beefsteak and drink martinis in every frontierworld dive? Let me tell you, Mr, Stedman, the answer is no.\" \"Try me, sir. That\\'s all I ask -- try me.\" \"We\\'re not running a school, Mr. Stedman. Either a man\\'s got it or he hasn\\'t. You haven\\'t. Come back in ten years. Ship out around the Solar System the hard way, and maybe we can use you then -- if you still remember what you learned about Extra-terrestrial zoology. What in space ever made you study extra-zoo, anyway?\" \"I found it interesting,\" Steve said lamely. \"Interesting? As a hobby, it\\'s interesting. But as business, it\\'s hard work, a lot of sweat, a lot of danger, squirming around on your soft belly in the muck and mud of a dozen worlds, that\\'s what it is. Just how do you think Carmical Enterprises got where they are? Sweat and grief, Mr. Stedman.\" Carmical yawned hugely and popped a glob of chocolate into his mouth. His fat lips worked for a moment, then his Adam\\'s apple bobbed up and down. Steve got up, paced back and forth in front of the desk. \"I won\\'t take no for an answer, Mn Carmical.\" \"Eh? What\\'s that? I could have you thrown out of here.\" \"You won\\'t,\" Steve told him calmly. \"Maybe I\\'m just what the doctor ordered, but you\\'ll never know until you try me. So -- \"So nothing! I said this isn\\'t a school.\" \"They tell me the G or dak leaves on a ten-world junket tomorrow. All I ask is this: let me ship along as the zoology man. Then, if you\\'re not satisfied, you can leave me at your first port-of-call -- without pay.\" Carmical smiled triumphantly. \"You know where we space out for first, Mr. Stedman? Mercury, that\\'s where. I\\'d love to see a sassy young pup like you set loose on Mercury in one of the Twilight Cities.\" \"Is it a deal?\" \"It sure is, Stedman. It sure is! But I warn you, we\\'ll expect perfection. You\\'ll not have a chance to profit from your own mistakes. You won\\'t have a chance to make mistakes. One slip and you\\'ve had it, is that understood?\" \"Yes.\" \"Pm not going, of course,\" Carmical said, patting his great paunch and saying with the action that he was too old and too fat for space; \"But Til hear all about the way you were stranded on Mercury, among a lot of Merkies and -- Steve smiled grimly, said: \"No you won\\'t. Next time you see me will be after the tenworld junket. Whom do I ask for on the Gordak? Carmical dialed for a bromo, watched it fizz in the glass, drank it, belched. \"T. J. Moore\\'s in charge,\" he told Steve. \"Old T. J.\\'s a mighty rough taskmaster, Stedman. Don\\'t say you weren\\'t warned.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Well, I\\'ll hear about how you were stranded on Mercury,\" Carmical predicted. \"You\\'ll see me after the tenworld junket,\" said Steve, and closed the door softly behind him the great jet-slagged underside of the Gordak, spraying fresh zircalloy in the aft tubes. Spaceport officers were everywhere in their crisp white uniforms, checking cargo, giving terse directives to the crew of the Gordaky lounging importantly at the foot of the gangplank. \"Name?\" one of them snapped at Steve. \"Stedman.\" The man flipped through a list of the expedition\\'s members. \"Stedman, huh? I don\\'t see -- oh, hererit is, in pencil at the bottom. Last minute addition, huh Stedman?\" \"Something like that,\" Steve admitted. \"Well, climb aboard.\" And ffien Steve was walking up the gangplank and into the cool metal interior of the Gordak. His palms were clammy, and he wondered if any of the crewmen within the ship noticed the sweat beading his forehead. He\\'d managed to come this far with a surprising degree of objectivity, and only now did reaction set in, causing his heart to beat fiercely and his limbs to grow weak. That T. . Moore must have been spawned in hell Charlie had said -- and now Charlie was dead. Because of T. J. Moore? Indirectly, perhaps, but T. J. Moore was responsible. Or, if you looked at it on a different level, the cutthroat competition between Carmical Enterprises and Barling Brothers Interplanetary was to blame. It didn\\'t matter, not really. Charlie was dead. That alone mattered. A big man with incredibly broad shoulders, hair the color of flame and a florid face to match it, came stalking down the companionway. Steve said, \"I wonder if you know where I can find T. J. Moore.\" The giant smiled. \"You crew or expedition?\" \"Expedition,\" said Steve, extending his hand. \"Steve Stedman\\'s my name,\" The hand that gripped his was hard and calloused. \"I\\'m Keyin McCann, boy. Sort of a liaison man between the crew and the expedition, only they call me the Exec to make everything official. Better take some advice -- don\\'t look for T. J. now. T. J.\\'s busy doing last minute things, and T. J. hates to be disturbed. Why don\\'t you wait till after Brennschluss when we\\'re out in space?\" \"It can\\'t wait. I\\'ve got to see that Moore knows I\\'m aboard and under what conditions, because I don\\': want to be thrown off this ship at the space-station. If Moore doesn\\'t like the conditions, Mr. Carinical can be called. But after we blast off it\\'ll be too late.\" Keyin McGann shrugged. \"It\\'s only advice I gave you, boy. You\\'ll find T. J. down on the third level looking over the cargo holds. Good luck.\" And McGann took a pipe from his pocket, tamping it full, lighting it and staring with frank, speculative curiosity at Steve. \"Stedman, eh?\" he mused. \"The name\\'s familiar.\" \"You think about it,\" said Steve, and made his way toward the third level. Perhaps some of them aboard the Gordak had known Charlie, and McGann, being the Exec, must have been around a long time. The third was the lowest level of the Gordak:, or that part of the ship nearest the tubes with the exception of the fission-room itself. Here on the third level were the cages which, in the months that followed, would hold the big game brought within the Gordak. But the word cage, Steve realized, can be misleading. A rectangular enclosure, its wall composed of evenly spaced bars -- that\\'s a cage. But the bubble-cages of the Gordak were something else again ; precisely as the name implied, they were huge bubbles of plastic, complete with remote-controlled airlocks. You could pump in any kind of atmosphere, from Jupiter\\'s lethal methane-ammonia mixture to the thin, oxygen-starved air of Mars, and under any desired pressure, too. And now on the third level a battery of experts was busy checking the bubble-cages for defects, since a leak after some noxious gas had been pumped into one of the bubbles could mean death for everyone aboard the Gordak. Steve stood there nervously  for what seemed a long while. He let his gaze rove up and down the third level, but he only saw the coverallclad technicians checking the bubble-cages. Kevin McGann had said he could find Moore here, but unless Moore zipped on a pair of coveralls himself and joined in the work -- which certainly seemed unlikely -- then Moore wasn\\'t around. shoulder. Startled, he whirled around. A woman stood there, just behind him, staring at him insolently. She was tall, as tall as Steve himself, with her close-cropped blond hair peeking out around the edges of a black cap. She wore what looked to Steve like a glossy black Martian sand-cape which she let fall straight down behind her so that it almost brushed the floor. Under it, she wore a brief pair of shorts, also black, and a halter. She was muscular in that lithe, feminine way which had grown so popular in the twenty-second century -- the century which had finally seen women come abreast of men in all sporting activities and surpass them in some which required special grace and lithe-limbed skill. \"I hope you found whatever you\\'re looking for,\" she said. She spoke with a complete lack of warmth which startled Steve for the second time in a few moments. She was a beautiful woman, he realized, but she looked so completely incongruous among the coveralled men that Steve found  himself whistling softly. \\'T never expected to find a girl here,\" he admitted. \"Not on this expedition.\" \"What\\'s the matter, are you old fashioned? This is the twenty-second century, the enlightened century, remember? There\\'s nothing a girl can\\'t do if she sets her mind to it. A recent survey shows that forty-percent of the homemakers in the U.S.N.A. are men, sixty percent women. Okay, it\\'s only logical that some of the remaining forty percent of females have some tough jobs, too.\" \"I read the books of the feminist movement,\" Steve assured her. \"But it\\'s going to take a lot to convince me of that. Me and a lot of other people, I suspect.\" \"Is that so, Mr. Smart-guy? Are you a member of the expedition?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, anytime you want to hustle down to the gym with me and go a few rounds, let me know.\" \"Are you serious?\" \"Of course I\\'m serious.\" \"Well,\" Steve said, deciding to change the subject and feeling utterly ridiculous about the whole conversation, \"let\\'s forget it. I was looking for T. J. Moore.\" The woman smiled coldly. \"That\\'s me. I\\'m T. J. What do you want?\" \"I -- uh -- what? You\\'re T. J.? You -- a girl?\" \"Will you please hurry with whatever you want to tell me? I haven\\'t got all day.\" \"My name\\'s Stedman.\" Steve felt his composure returning. The fact that T. J. Moore was a woman didn\\'t make any difference. But unconsciously, Steve regarded her as a member of the weaker sex, and a large chunk of her fearsome reputation vanished because of it. \"I wondej: if Mr. Carmical contacted you -- \"He sure did, Stedman.\" \"Good, then we can -- \"Maybe you think it\\'s good. I think it stinks. Listen, Stedman, maybe you think you can pull the wool over my eyes like you did over Brody Carmical -- but you can\\'t. He didn\\'t recognize you.r name, I did. No kid brother of Charlie Stedman\\'s going to make trouble for me because he thinks I was responsible for his brother\\'s death.\" \"I didn\\'t say -- \" \"You didn\\'t have to say. I can see it in your face. But get this straight, Stedman. Your brother died op Ganymede three years ago -- of natural causes, that is, if you can call some of the local fauna \\'natural causes\\'. He worked for Barling Brothers Interplanetary, so I guess the rivalry between them and us didn\\'t help. But no one killed him.\" \"I didn\\'t say -- \" \"Is that all you can say, \\'you didn\\'t say?\\' Try to tell me why you came aboard the Gordak; go ahead, try.\" \"I\\'m an expert in Extra-terrestrial zoology, and you needed one. Mr. Carmical hired me.\" \"I know that. \\'But I guess I also know a thing or\\'wo which Brody Carmical doesn\\'t. All right, Stedman. You come as far as Mercury. But one slip, just one slip -- \" \"Okay, T. J.,\" Steve said, almost jauntily. \"I\\'ll watch my step.\" \"I\\'m the Gordaks ctain. You\\'ll call me that. Captain -- is it clear?\" \"No,\" said Steve, and laughed. The ten-world junket would be a hard, driving, gruelling ordeal come what might, and he wouldn\\'t kowtow to T. J. Moore, male or female, here at the beginning. \"No,\" he said again, forcing the laughter out. \"This isn\\'t a military ship, so you won\\'t impose any arbitrary dis\\' cipline on me.\" The woman laughed too, but it was more effective. \"I won\\'t, won\\'t I? Once we leave Earth, Stedman, everythirig we do is dangerous. \\' Everything. I\\'ve got to have full authority, every order obeyed at the drop of a hat. Understand?\" \"No.\" The woman removed the black cap from her head, and Steve no ticed, not without surprise, that hr pale blond hair wasn\\'t closecropped after all. It had been piled up inside the cap, and now it spilled down loosely about her shoulders. Smiling, she dropped the cap to the floor. \"Pick it up,\" she said. \"Are you kidding? I\\'m an expert on Extra-terrestrial zoology. That\\'s what Mr. Carmical hired me for. If you want that hat picked up, better do it yourself,\" Vaguely, Steve wondered if Charlie had met the woman those final days on far Ganymede, had fought with her tooth and nail for some priceless specimen -- and lost, with no witness but the bleak, desolate topography of the Jovian moon. The woman turned away from him, called: \"LeClarc! LeClarc, come here.\" ures approached them, a thickthe wed man whose muscular strength couldn\\'t be hidden by the baggy clothing. Not as tall as Steve or the woman, he was broad of shoulder and thick through the . chest. He had a dark face and deep-set black eyes, and a thin scar ran the length of his fight cheek, from eye to chin. \"Yes, Captain?\" \"Stedman here is new. He questions my authority. I wondered if you\\'d like to work him over some -- \" \"A pleasure,\" growled the stocky, gnarled Frenchman, arid swung his right fist up ill a quick, blurring motion. Steve didn\\'t have time to parry it. The blow caught him flush on the mouth and jarred his teeth, sent him crashing back; against the wall where he slid down slowly until he was sitting on the floor. Groggily, he got to his feet, wiping his bloody lips with the fingers of one hand. LeClarc, chuckling, hit him once more before he could quite pull himself together. The right hand slammed against his stomach this time, driving the wind from his lungs. He started to fall, but he clawed at LeClarc\\'s middle as he went down, and held on. Still chuckling, LeClarc cuffed him about the ears almost playfully, but the openpalmed blows stung him and sent wild rage coursing through his blood. Clearly, that was the idea. LeClarc was enjoying himself -- but LeClarc wanted him to fight back. Steve got a hand up in front of his body, palm up, and drove it against the Frenchman\\'s chin. He felt the neck snap back sharply, heard the sudden click as LeClarc\\'s teeth met with savage force. Bellowing, the Frenchman came at him again, fighting southpaw and bringing a roundhouse left from back behind his body. But Steve\\'s wind had returned and now he sobbed air in great gulps. He ducked the wild swing and found the Frenchman wideopen, pounded lefts and rights to the man\\'s midsection. LeClarc, stunned now, brought his guard down. Steve was in no hurry. He chased the dazed LeClarc around an ever-widening circle, was dimly aware that the other technicians had stopped their work to watch. He jabbed with his left hand, covering the olive face with purple welts. He held the right cocked but did not throw it. Soon, though, he could hear the other technicians -- who probably liked a good brawl ; -- muttering. The idea, as they saw it, wasn\\'t to cut LeClarc up completely but instead, to win swiftly. Shrugging, Steve realized that the anger he felt for the woman had blinded him, and after that, he unleashed his right hand, felt the searing contact with LeClarc\\'s jaw, saw a couple of teeth clatter off the wall as the Frenchman\\'s mouth flew open. Sagging first at the knees, then the waist, LeClarc fell to the floor and huddled there inertly. Steve turned to the woman, spoke out of fastswelling lips. \"You\\'re the Captain and I only work here. Tee jay,\" he made the initials sound like a name. \"So I\\'ll take your orders -- provided they make sense. That one about the cap didn\\'t. If you want it picked up, you\\'d better stoop for it yourself.\" Not looking back, he climbed the stairs toward the second level, wiping his bloody lips with a handkerchief. showed him around the Got dak after Brennschluss. Newton\\'s second law of motion carried the ship forward through the near-vacuum of space now, and it would continue that way, plowing ahead at seven miles per second until it was caught and slowed by the space-station\\'s gravity. There the bunkers would be reloaded with slow-fission plutonium for the long dash sunward to Mercury. \"... and through there you\\'ll find the fission-room,\" Kevin was saying. \"That\\'s about the size of it, boy. But I warn you to keep away from the fission-room long as that red light is blinking. Everything inside gets pretty hot, and there\\'s enough radiation to kill an army unless the shields are up. Even then, I\\'d recommend a vac-suit.\" \"I\\'ll remember that,\" Steve said, lighting a cigarette. \"Word gets around a ship like the Gordak pretty fast. I didn\\'t see your fight with LeClarc, but I sure heard enough about it. There\\'s only one man aboard ship who can beat the Frenchman in a fair fight, and -- \" \"You?\" Steve wanted to know. But it was hardly a question. It looked to him like Kevin could take on two LeClarcs with no trouble at all. \"Yes, boy. Me. But now there are two of us, and you\\'ve made yourself an enemy. LeClarc doesn\\'t forget easy, so you\\'d better be on your guard.\" \"I\\'ll remember that, too,\" said Steve, laughing. \"But it looks like you keep warning me about something all the time, Kevin. Why?\" \"You\\'re Charlie Stedman\\'s kid brother, aren\\'t you?\" \"Yeah. Yeah, but how did -- \" \"How did I know, boy? It\\'s written all over your face, and Charlie may have been with Barling Interplanetary, but a lot of us knew him. Charlie was the best, boy.\" \"Thanks. Kevin, how did Charlie die?\" The giant shrugged eloquently. \"I don\\'t know. It was T. J. who found him out on Ganymede. She was out tracking an anthrovac, and you don\\'t track anthrovacs in crowds. Well, it seems Charlie had landed for Barling, and Charlie had the same idea.\" \"He never told me Teejay was a woman, but he said once she must have been reared in hell.\" Again, Kevin shrugged. \"It\\'s open to question, boy. I don\\'t like T. J., but I like working for her. You take a man like LeClarc, he\\'ll die for T. J. All she\\'d have to do is ask him, and he\\'d die. You see, boy, big game hunters don\\'t come any smarter. Trouble is, T. J. knows it and flaunts it. Also, she\\'s a woman but she\\'s strong as a man and knows that, too. She dares you to fight her every step of the way, and it takes a big man to -- \" \"I thought you said Charlie was the best!\" \"And I still do. But a man\\'s got to have some flaws. Maybe he couldn\\'t take T. J. and had to let her know. The same thing happened to you, after only five minutes. The gals have won their spurs in every field which was strictly masculine a hundred years ago. Men tend to resent that, especially when a talented woman like T. J. let\\'s them know it, and no bones about it. So, that\\'s T. J.\" \"Yeah,\" said Steve, frowning. \"That\\'s Teejay.\" \"What\\'s the trouble, boy?\" \"I\\'ve got to find out what happened to Charlie, that\\'s all. But Tee jay\\'s going to be a problem.\" \"The grandmother of all problems, you mean. With all of that, though, she can still be all female when she wants to be. Maybe Charlie fell for her -- \" \"Charlie falling for that cheap, no good -- \" \"Careful, boy. She\\'s my Captain, and a good one. I wouldn\\'t ship out on the Gordak if I didn\\'t think so. Careful.\" Then Kevin smiled. \"You\\'ll learn, in time. Anyway, Charlie was a good-looker and attractive to the girls, he was romantic -- so maybe T. J. fell for him, too. Then they had a parting of the ways and -- \"Sure!\" Steve exploded. \"Sure, they fell in love or something only Charlie forgot to mention in any of his letters she was a woman. You\\'re barking up the wrong tree, Kevin.\" \"Maybe. Maybe not. I\\'jn only talking off the top of my head, boy. But it\\'s worth considering.\" Kevin jabbed a thick finger against his calloused palm. \"What I\\'m getting at is this, whether they made love or not, I don\\'t think T. J. would kill anyone out of cold blood.\" \"I\\'ll think about it,\" said Steve, and then a whistle shrilled through the length of the ship. They were nearing the space-station, half as far from Earth as Luna, and deceleration came upon them gradually and would continue to increase until they all had to bed down in the accel-hammocks for landing. U nexpec tedly , T eej ay herself was checking in the members of the expedition as their two-hour stop over at the station drew to an end. As he approached her along the gangplank, Steve looked down and saw the station-men wheeling the small but tremendously lavy plutonium bunkers under the ship, each compact unit weighing a couple of tons with its concrete shielding\"Well, Stedman,\" said the woman, the broad black sand-cape wrapped around her completely now, as if only the members of her crew had the right to see what lay beneath it, \"I see you\\'ve never watched a ship getting ready for blast off.\" \"That\\'s right,\" Steve admitted. \"First trip out.\" \"You want some pretty sound advice? I\\'d suggest you stay here at the station and wait for the first Earthbound ship.\" \"Thanks,\" said Steve. \"But Mr. Carmical hired me at least as far as Mercury, so that\\'s where I\\'m going.\" Tee jay grinned. \"You\\'re a plucky kid, Stedman. All right, Mercury it is -- but LeClarc can do the honors when it\\'s time to see you off the Gordak for good. He doesn\\'t exactly like you, Stedman.\" \"I\\'ve been told that.\" \"All ight, move along. There\\'s a whole line of men I\\'ve got to check in behind you.\" A plucky kid, Steve thought, and laughed. She\\'d called him that, although he knew she\\'d probably have a hard time matching his twenty-five years. Well, she\\'d spent her life in space and on the frontier worlds. Maybe that did make a difference. Five minutes later, they blasted clear of the space-station on an orbit that would intersect the Mercurian ellipse at perihelion... From there, the Gordak would visit Venus, Mars, the planetoid Ceres, the four large Jovian moons. Titan and Uranus. Ten worlds in all the hunters would touch on -- and each world would offer up its native fauna for the Brody Carmical Circus, Steve wondered if there\\'d be\\' trouble with Barling Brothers Interplanetary. There generally was. But then he smiled without mirth, for the chances were he\\'d never get beyond the first landing on Mercury, anyway. Gordald\\' crew and another thirty-odd in the expedition, and a space ship being the complicated, labyrinthine device that it is, it wasn\\'t too strange that Steve failed to encounter LeClarc until immediately before landing on Mercury. Then the Gordak\\'s deceleration tubes had cut in and Steve found the most readily available accel-hammock in the general lounge. The Frenchman was stretched out on the cushions three feet from him. LeClarc said, \"This will be a terrible, hot place.\" \\'T know. At perihelion, Mei cury\\'s not much more than thirty Frenchman wanted to bury the hatchet, fine. LeClarc strained to raise himself on his elbows against the increasing deceleration. \"Sure,\" he said, \"a hot place. After you foul up, Stedman, my vote will be to leave you on the hot side ihstead of giving you passage to the twilight zone.\" The Frenchman was being illogical and pointlessly childish. \"I didn\\'t ask you to fight with me,\" Steve told him. \"Why don\\'t we forget all about it?\" \"If you want to, forget. I, LeClarc, never forget.\" \"By space, LeClarc -- \" the voice came from the other side of the lounge -- then you\\'re a spoiled little child.\" It was the big Exec officer who spoke, Kevin McCann. LeClarc did not answer. Kevin winked at Steve, then set his face grimly against the bone-crushing deceleration. Fifteen minutes later, they landed at Furnacetown. The names of the new frontier settlements, Steve thought with a grin, were as picturesque as the names of the old Wild West towns. There was a . huge, priceless matrix of ruby far below the surface near Furnacetown, and the frontier settlement existed to mine from it. But the place was named aptly, for here on the hot side of Mercury, the temperature was hot enough to melt tin and lead. A community of half a thousand hearty souls, Furnacetown shielded itself from the swollen, never-setting , sun with a vacuum-insulated dome worth of cooling equipment. Even so, the atmosphere within the dome was a lot like New Orleans on a sultry summer day. The mayor of the town, a man named Powlaski, met them at the landing field. \"It\\'s hot,\" said Teejay, offering her hand and shaking with the plump official, man-fashion, \"It\\'s always hot. Captain Moore. At any rate, be happy that you\\'ve beaten Barling here this time.\" \"Oh, did we? Good. Wenineed three asbestos suits, Powlaski. I never did trust plain vac-suits on the sunward side of this boiling mess of a planet. Say, has anyone got a cool drink? I\\'m roasting.\" Someone wheeled out a portable refrigerator and the synthetic ginand-orange stored therein tasted to Steve\\'s thirsty lips almost like the real thing. Then LeClarc, who had ventured into one of the squat buildings with Powlaski\\'s lieutenant, a middle-aged woman, returned with three heavy asbestos suits draped ponderously over his arm. Their combined weight was perhaps two hundred pounds, but it became negligible under Mercurys weak gravity. \"We\\'re ready\\' he said, extending one of the suits to Teejay and helping her slip it on over her shorts and halter. This was the first time that Steve had ever seen her without the black cape, which seemed a sort of aflfected trade-mark. \"Three suits?\" Steve demanded. \"What for?\" \"The third one\\'s for you, Stedman,\" the woman told him. \"I know your job is to see that the game stays alive in our bubblecages, but I don\\'t think it would hurt if you had a look-see at the stone worm in its own environment.\" \"That\\'s not what I meant,\" Steve told her. \"Why LeClarc?\" Teejay shrugged, zipping up the suit. \"Because I said so, that\\'s why. Also, LeClarc\\'s something of an expert on the inner planets and he goes wherever I do, anyway.\" \"Sort of a bodyguard,\" the Frenchman purred, strapping a neutron gun to the belt of his asbestos suit. \"Hey, who\\'s got those helmets?\" And then Steve felt them slipping the thick, clumsy helmet over his head. Kevin stood nearby and the Exec looked like he wanted to say something, but Steve\\'s helmet had snapped into place and from that point he could only talk by radio -- and over the crackling interference of the swollen sun at that. Moments later, he\\'d stepped through an airlock at the side of the Fumacetown dome and plodded out on the surface of Mercury. soupy atmosphere and the verdant tropical jungles. On Mars, the rusty desert and the ruins of an eon-old civilization. But on Mercury you knew at once that you trod upon an alien world. At perihelion, the sun swelled to almost four times its size as seen from Earth, and because Mercury\\'s tenuous atmosphere had boiled off into sky was black. The sun had lost its spherical shape, too. Great solar prominences licked out at the blackness, and the visible corona seemed to swell and pulse. Underfoot, Steve could feel the crunchy ground powdering beneath his asbestos boots with every step. And far off toward the horizon, a jagged ridge of blood-red mountains bit at the black sky like festering, toothless gums. Before long, Tee jay\\'s voice sang in Steve\\'s earphones. \"Over here, you boys.\" And Steve could see her crouching, shapeless in the loose asbestos suit, off to his left. The sun\\'s heat had parched a long, snaking crack in the surface and Steve lumbered over to it clumsily, letting his shadow fall across the crevice. \"Those stone worms are umbra-tropic,\" he called, and waited. \"I don\\'t wonder,\" said Teejay, looking up at the sun through the smoked goggles of her helmet. The stone worms, Steve knew, were attracted by darkness -- hence they generally dwelled in the deepest crevices, although a man\\'s shadow might bring them to the surface. He\\'d never seen a stone worm, but he\\'d read about them and seen their pictures. \"You\\'ll see something very unlovely,\" Teejay predicated. \"The stone worm isn\\'t a carbon-basic animal, but a silicate creature with a sodium-silicon-nitrogen economy. It\\'s about four feet long and kind of like some ghastly white slug. It -- hey, Stedman, get on your toes!\" The worm was coming. It poked its head up out of the crevice first, and then the slug-like body followed, curling quite instinctively until the whole thing lay in Steve\\'s shadow. Four feet long and a foot across at tlte middle it looked like the product of nightmare. The head was one huge, lidless, glassy eye -- with a purple-lipped mouth where the pupil should have been I The mouth opened and shut like that of a fish, but when Steve lifted the monster by its middle and brought it out into the sun, the lips puckered completely shut and the white slug began to thrash dangerously. But under the influence of the sun\\'s heat it soon subsided. Trouble was, Steve thought vaguely as they made their way back toward Furnacetown with the quiescent monster, the sun\\'s heat did not subside. Probably, it was his imagination, but the sun had seemed to become, if anything, stronger. He looked at the others, but they merely walked forward, completely unconcerned. Maybe he\\'d tired himself subduing the stone worm, for he knew that might seem to intensify the heat. Inside his asbestos suit, Steve began to sweat. It did not start slowly, but all at once the perspiration streamed down his face and body. It was then that his left leg began to bum. Down below the knee it was, a knife-edged burning sensation which became worse with each passing second. Someone had heated a knife white-hot, had applied its sharp point to the nerveendings of his leg -- and then twisted. It felt like that.  Screaming hoarsely, Steve fell, watched through burning eyes as the stone worm commenced crawling laboriously away. Itwas LeGlarc who went after the worm and retrieved it, but Teejay knelt at Steve\\'s side and, surprisingly, real concern was in her voice when it came over the radio. \"What\\'s the trouble, Stedman?\" \"I don\\'t know,\" Steve gritted. \"I\\'m hot all over -- and my leg feels like it\\'s on fire. Yeah, right there -- owl -- go easy!\" Teejay frowned or at least Steve guessed she frowned by the way she spoke. \"There\\'s nothing much we can do about it, Stedman. Seerns to be a hole -- just a pinprick, but a hole -- in the asbestos. It\\'s a wonder you weren\\'t screaming bloody murder before this. How\\'s the air?\" It was getting hard to breathe, Steve realized, but dimly, for his senses wereReceding into a fog of half-consciousness. Something hissed in his ears and he knew Teejay had turned the outside dial of his air-pump all the way over. It made him feel momentarily better, but the pain still cut into his leg. \"I\\'ve got the worm,\" said LeClarc. \"But what happened to him?\" He asked thfe question innocently -- too innocently. Teejay didn\\'t answer. Instead: \"Can vou walk, Stedman?\" \"I -- I don\\'t think so.\" \"Then I\\'ll carry you. But remember this: if we get you back all right, you can thank the twentysecond century feminist movement. Gan you picture an old-fashioned gal slinging a man over her shoulder and toting him away to safety like a sack of grain? Here we go.\" And she got her arms under Steve\\'s shoulder, tugging him upright and swinging him across her back in a fireman\\'s carry. He felt in no mood to question her motive, but he could sense the triumph in her as if she had said, \"See, I\\'m as strong, as a man, and don\\'t you forget it.\" In spite of himself, he couldn\\'t help responding to the unspoken challenge. \"Sure,\" he said, \"I can thank the feminist movement, but more than that I can thank Mercury\\'s light gravity, Teejay. We\\'re lucky I don\\'t weigh more than fifty pounds here.\" An hour later they arrived back at Furnace town, buf by then Steve was unconscious from the pain. X X boy?\" It was Kevin Me- Gann, the battered, unlit pipe clamped tightly between his teeth as he spoke. Steve sat propped up in a bed in the Gordaks infirmary, his left leg wrapped in bandages from knee to ankle. \"Pretty good, I guess. Kind of weak, but there\\'s no pain.\" \"You\\'re lucky the Captain got you back here in time. Four inches of your calf was cooked third degree, but she carried you back here soon enough to cut it away before deep decomposition, and spray on syntheplasm. You\\'ll be as good as new in a week, and no scar, either. Thanks to the Captain, boy.\" \"Yeah,\" Steve admitted. \"Sure. But what I want to know is this: hOw did it happen?\" Kevin shrugged his massive shoulders. \"I won\\'t make any accusations, boy, not without positive proof. But I took the liberty to examine your suit, and it looked to me like someone had punctured a small hole almost all the way through. The heat did the rest.\" \"You mean LeClarc?\"  \"I never said that. But LeClarc was the one who got the suits, so he -- more than anyone -- was in a position to do something like that. Further than that I won\\'t carry it. This is not an accusation.\" \"Suits me,\" Steve told him. \"And thanks, Kevin. But after this, Frenchie had better watch his step. Are we out in space again?\" \"Yes. Passed Brennschluss fortyeight hours ago.\" \"What?\" \"Sure. They had you doped up for two days, till the syntheplasm had a chance to set.\" \"How soon can I get out of bed?\" \"Depends. If you don\\'t mind hobbling around on crutches, today probably. If you want to wait till you can walk, four or five days. What\\'s your hurry, boy?\" \"I\\'ve got to take care of that stone worm, remember?\" \"Say, that\\'s right! No one knew what to do, so they suspended it in a deep freeze until you could go to\" work. A hideous brute, I might add\\' \"Will you ask the doctor to give me some crutches? Swell. First, though, I\\'d like a good meal. And listen, Kevin -- I guess Tee jay saved my life, at that. Want to tell her I\\'d like to see her?\" \"Of course,\" said Kevin, and left the whitewalled infirmary, grinning from ear to ear. By the? time Teejay arrived, Steve was eating his first solid meal in two days. \"Hello,\" he said. He almost found himself adding, \"Captain\" -- but he checked the impulse just in time, \"McCann tells me you\\'re ready to get to work today.\" \"That\\'s right.\" \"Good. That stone worm won\\'t stay in ice indefinitely -- not when it lives on the sun-side of Mercury.\" \"Teejay, I want to -- well, I want to thank you for saving my life.\" The woman opened her cape, reached inside, took a pack of cigarettes from an inside pocket and puffed on one until it glowed. \"Don\\'t thank me,\" she said coolly. \"It really isn\\'t necessary. You\\'re the only extra-zoo man aboard, Stedman, so we needed you. I\\'d have saved a valuable machine under the same circumstances,\"  \"Well, thanks anyway.\" \"There\\'s one thing more, Sted- man. As far as I\\'m concerned, you haven\\'t proven yourself yet. So the same conditions apply to our next landing point.\" \"Where\\'s that?\" \"Venus, of course. Do you think I want to play hop-scotch all over the Solar System? Well, you finish your meal and give that stone worm a nice comfortable bubble to live in.\" And Teejay departed. ated the air from one of the bubble-cages and increased the temperature to seven hundred degrees Fahrenheit, after he\\'d supervised a slow warming process for the worm and seen it deposited, still drowsy, in the bubble with sufficient quantities of silicon-compounds to keep it well fed, Steve hobbled with his crutches to the general lounge. Teejay sat there with half a dozen of the Venusian experts, for the hunt would be much more protracted on that teeming jungle-world. The woman stood up at once and crossed the floor to Steve. \"How\\'s the worm?\" \"Fine.\" He always felt a little edgy and on his guard when the woman spoke to him. \"And how\\'s the extra-zoo expert\\'s bum leg.\" \"Coming along, I think.\" Teejay turned to the six men seated around the lounge, said : \"This is Steve Stedman, our extrazoo man -- at least temporarily! about amphibians than any man alive, lanelio is our aboreal expert, Smith ferrets out the cave-dwelling mammals -- we hope, Waneki goes floundering around after sea-monsters, St. Clair is -- \" Then something buzzed shrilly on the adjacent wall, and Teejay flipped a toggle switch. \"Captain here.\" \"Radio from Earth, Captain. Mr. Brody Carmical himself.\\' \"Is that so?\" said Teejay, her eyebrows lifting. \"Give me a circuit.\" And, a moment later, \\'that\\'s the trouble, Brody?\" The big man\\'s voice came through faint and metallic over space. \"Plenty, T. J., Barling decided to start in the middle this year. Some of our -- er, contacts told us his ship\\'s rocketing for Ganymede, and fast. You\\'ll have to get there first if you can, naturally.\" \"We\\'ll get there,\" said Teejay, quite grim, and cut the connection. Steve had time to think one thought before he was swept along in the general rush, crutches and all, after the woman galvanized into activity. She might take orders from Brody Carmical, but she even had a way with the big man, making him cow to her -- perhaps unconsciously. Teejay was yelling and pointing, it seemed, in all directions at once. \"Hey you, lanello, shake a leg down to the fission-room and tell \\'em to start straining. Smith, get me Kevin McGann on the intercom. Waneki, you can forget all about those Venusian sea-monsters and tell the docs to be ready for plenty of acceleration cases. You better bed as strong as the rest of us, not with sixty years of junketing behind you. Hello, McGann? Listen, Mac, I want the entire crew assembled in General inside of ten minutes. Yeah, expedition too. Everyone but those boys down in fission. And tell your orbit-man to figure a way to get us off this trajectory and on a quick ellipse from here to the Jovian moons. Yes, that\\'s what I said -- the Jovian moons.\" She paused long enough to take a breath and turn to Steve. \"Well, Stedman, we\\'ll be dropping down over your brother\\'s grave on Ganym,ede before you know it. Maybe then you\\'ll be able to remove that chip from your shoulder.\" \"Me? From my shoulder? Sister, you\\'ve got things backwards.\" But the woman pivoted away, and Kevin\\'s voice bleated over the intercom : \"Crew and expedition -- all to general lounge on the double! You boys in fission stay put. Captain\\'s orders. This is urgent.\" Almost before Kevin\\'s voice had stopped echoing through the corridors, LeClarc popped into the lounge. \"You wanted me. Captain? May I help?\" \"I wanted everyone. Everyone can help. Just sit still till the rest of \\'em get here.\" LeClarc appeared hurt, but he took a seat in glum silence. In twos and threes the members of the crew began to drift in, wild rumors circulating among them in whispers. Finally, LeClarc counted noses and told his Captain that everyone except the fission crew was present. Teejay nodded, stepped to the center of the floor. She removed her cape and dropped it, discarding it so suddenly and yet with such a polished flourish that a complete silence fell upon the large room almost at once. She paced back and forth, her bare, lithe limbs flashing under the green-glowing wall panels. \"You\\'ve all come to know that cape,\" she said, her voice strident and alive. \"It\\'s a sort of affectation I have. But it\\'s not necessary. Like everything that\\'s not necessary, it must be discarded, at least temporarily. Men, we\\'re in serious trouble.\" Just like that, inside of a few sec onds, she had them eating out of the palm of her hand. She went on to say that Barling\\'s ship had already blasted off from the Earth for Ganymede, how,, unless their efforts here on the Gordak were Herculean and then some, Barling\\'s ship would reach Ganymede first, \"And you all know what that would mean,\" she continued. \"Like the elephant of two centuries ago, the Ganymeden anthrovac is the one solid necessity for any circus sideshow. But the anthrovacs have a way of going into hiding when they\\'re disturbed. So, if Barling gets to Ganymede first, we\\'ve had it. We can all start looking for jobs after that, do you understand? I want full acceleration from here to Ganymede, as soon as we can get the new orbit plotted. Nothing but the immediate problem -- to reach the Jovian moons before Barling -- nothing else matters. If I tell you to work two shifts and go without sleep one night, you will do that. If I decide that a man must go beyond the shieldings in fission, he\\'ll climb into a vac-suit and hope for the best. It\\'s going to be like that, men, and I can\\'t help it. I crack the whip and you jump. Any questions?\" She stood dramatically, hands on hips, somehow poised on tip-toes without straining, a tall, impressive and quite beautiful figure. \"Yes,\" said one of the orbiteers... \"I have a question. Can I get to work on the new orbit at once?\" There were hoarse shouts of approval, some applause and a scattering of deep-throated laughter. Steve watched Tee jay walk off her improvised stage, complete master of the situation. If it were humanly possible for the Gordak to reach Ganymede before Barling, they\\'d do it. Steve learned something of what the big Exec officer had meant that first day he had spoken about Teejay. She drove her men relentlessly and some of them may have resented it. But she drove herself as well, and once when a crewman had gone beyond the shieldings to repair the mechanical arms which regulated the flow of powdered plutonium fuel from the bunkers and had emerged with a serious case of radiation sickness, Tee jay donned a vac-suit and went in herself to finish the job. Most of the men liked her. Some, frankly, did not. But all of them knew they served under a captain as good as any. Two days before landing on Ganymede, Tee jay gathered her chief lieutenants for a final\\' planning session. Kevin was there, and LeClarc, and a tall, wraith-thin man with a bushy head of white hair named Simonson, and Steve. Teejay spread a chart out and peered down at it intently. \"This is Ganymede Northeast,\" she said, indicating the circled, central area of the map. \"It is here that, for some reason, the anthrovacs gather. And here inside the circle is an area of one thousand square miles which Mr. Simonson has marked off -- yes, Stedman, the red square. We\\'ll be operating there. If the Barling ship has landed ahead of us, we can assume the same for them.\" Teejay paused to light a cigarette, then crushed it out after her first puff. \"The dam smoke gets in my way when I try to think,\" she smiled, and went on, \"Anyway, here\\'s the square. We\\'ll be using the crew and the expedition -- everyone aboard ship -- because we\\'re in a hurry. Simply put, we\\'ll be a bunch of beaters to drive the anthrovacs together at the center of the square. Then, well, then it\\'s up to Mr. Simonson and Stedman. Any questions?\" \"Yes, Captain,\" said LeGlarc. \"Just how do we get the anthrovacs aboard ship?\" \"Don\\'t ask me. But you might ask Mr. Simonson.\" The bushy-haired man named Simonson grunted. \"Umm-mm. There are several ways. We could set up elaborate traps, such as Thomdyke employed two years ago, and -- \"Can\\'t,\" Teejay objected. \"No time.\" \"Why don\\'t we just clobber them?\" LeGlarc suggested. \"A few might die, but we\\'ll get the specimens we want.\" Steve shook his head. \"You don\\'t know your anthrovacs. Chase them and they\\'ll try to run away. But hurt them -- just hurt otle of them so the rest of them can see -- and they\\'ll swarm all over you until either all the men or all the anthrovacs are dead, or both. No, there\\'s another way.\" \"What\\'s that?\" Teejay leaned forward, chin cupped in hands, definitely interested.  \"Anthrovacs are non-breathers. Most gasses won\\'t hurt them, but you can give them a good, old-fashioned oxygen jag with the slightest whiff of pure oxygen.\" \"I\\'ve heard of that,\" Simonson said. \"Sort of like getting them drunk, isn\\'t it, boy?\" Kevin wanted to know. But LeClarc wasn\\'t satisfied. \"I still say we ought to clobber them. We can\\'t waste time experimenting\\' with any crazy jags.\" \"It\\'s no experiment,\" Steve told him coldly. \"It works.\" \"I still say we ought to -- \" \"Clobber them, I know,\" Teejay finished for him. \"If there\\'s any clobbering to be done, LeClarc, I\\'ll let you know. Meanwhile, we\\'re trying Stedman\\'s plan. Any further questions?\" And, when no one spoke : \"Good. Mac, I want you to let Mr. Simonson and Stedman pick three men to help \\'em. You\\'re to divide the rest of us into groups of half a dozen each, with each group serving under a leader. I\\'ll give each leader a designated area in that square, so there won\\'t be a lot of bumbling around when we land on Ganymede. LeClarc!\" \"Yes, Captain?\" \"Take yourself a group of three idle technicians and check all the vac-suits. If there\\'s any trouble, make sure it\\'s repaired before we land. What are you gawking at me like that for?\" \"I only thought -- \" \"What? What did you think? Speak up, manJ\" \"I thought you would have a job of more import for me. Had you, for example, decided that we ought to clobber -- \" \"Clobber, clobber, clobber! Will you shut up and get to work?\" \"Yes, Captain,\" And more than a little stooped of shoulder, LeClarc left the lounge. Tee jay didn\\'t pause for breath. \"You, Stedman! What\\'s so funny? What are you laughing about?\" \"Nothing. It\\'s just the way LeGlarc -- \" \"Forget it, before you get clobbered.\" After the landing, an unreasoning fear gripped Steve tightly. It wasn\\'t anything he could put his  finger on, but he felt it gnawing at the fringes of his mind, probing, seeking, thrusting for a way in. There was nothing to be afraid of, and Steve smoked one cigarette after another while the six-man parties disembarked to take up their beater-stations on the edges of the square. , Ganymede, he recited to himself, is the largest satellite in the Solar System. # miles from Jupiter, it has a diameter of thirty two hundred and six miles, or bigger than the planet Mercury and almost as large as Pluto. It swings around Jupiter in a little over seven Earth days and in appearance the moonscape\\'s enough like Luna to be a twin-brother, except for fat, bloated Jupiter hanging in the sky. What was there to be afraid of? Steve didn\\'t know. His brother had died on Ganymede -- and the circumstances of Charlie\\'s death still bordered on the mysterious. Well, he\\'d see for himself about that. Did the fear crawl around the edges of his brain because he thought Teejay was responsible? But that didn\\'t make sense, for to a certain degree he\\'d thought that all along. Unless the appalling thought of having to fight Tee jay and her whole loyal crew had taken hold of him unconsciously. \"What are you moping about, boy?\" \"Huh? Oh, Kevin. Nothing much, I guess. I -- \" \"You look to me like you\\'ve seen a ghost. What is it, scared?\" \"Yeah, Yeah, I guess so.\" \"So what? Buck up, boy.\" \"I don\\'t want to be scared, Kevin.\" \"Who does?\" \"That\\'s not what I \\' mean. It\\'s one thing to say that if you aren\\'t -- \" \"Who isn\\'t? Don\\'t look at me, boy. And didn\\'t you watch all the men trooping outside with the blood drained from their faces, and their eyes sort of big and too bright behind the face-plates? We\\'re all scared.\" \"But why?\" \"Mean to say you spent so much time on zoology and forgot about other things? Like, for instance, Ganymede-f ear ?\" \"Huh? How\\'s that?\"  \"Everyone is afraid, Steve. Everyone... Whenever a man gets near Ganymede, he suddenly becomes afraid. It\\'s some sort of a psychological or maybe para-psychological phenomenon and none of the medicos could ever figure it out. It isn\\'t the kind of fear that paralyzes, boy, but still, it holds on all the time a man\\'s on Ganymede and it doesn\\'t leave until he blasts off again. Didn\\'t you ever hear about that?\" \"No. That is, I knew it happened somewhere, but I forgot where.\" \"Well, that\\'s all there is to it, boy.\" \\' \"All! Don\\'t you think it\\'s enough? Something lurks out there, something makes people afraid, and we\\'ve never been able to find out why, but you say -- \" Tee jay came up and smiled at them, but there was something grirri about her smile. \"You can always tell when someone comes to Ganymede for the first time. He\\'s jumpier. Just relax, Stedman. By the time they start beating the anthrovacs in toward the G or dak you\\'ll be feeling better -- and raring to go  to work with that oxygenjag stunt of yours, too.\" And she added, \"Say, have you been watching your stone worm?\"  \"He sure has,\" Kevin told her. \"He took me down there yesterday and that worm\\'s been growing fat on all the sand he\\'s fed it. Sand -- for food, that\\'s what the worm eats. Imagine how that would settle the over-population problems on Earth if people, too, could eat sand.\" \"Yes, and then -- \" Tee jay was speaking again -- but words, just words, and Steve stopped listening. It occurred to him all at once that they were engrossed in their meaningless conversation for one reason only -- to keep the fear from their minds. If you thought about something else, the fear would retreat at least in part, and if you could hold a conversation about everything and nothing, that was even better. Steve almost jumped off the floor when a metallic voice blared forth from the loudspeaker, echoing and re-echomg in the near-empty room. \"Captain! Captain, this is Moretti, Group Seven.\" \"Go ahead, Moretti,\" Teejay said into the mike. \"I\\'m listening.\" \"Who the devil\\'s on radar. Captain?\" \"Why -- no one! We forgot.\" \"There\\'s a ship coming dwn. We can see it plain as day out here.\" \"What diip?\" Teejay asked softly, but they all knew the question was totally unnecessary. Moretti\\'s voice jumped an octave as he cried: \"It\\'s Barling!\" the beaters had been called in. Barling\\'s big ship, the Frank Buck, snorted back and forth angrily on its landing jets. \"Are they gonna land or ain\\'t they gonna land?\" someone said as Kevin broke out the neutron guns and saw that every third man had one. \"Depends on their boss,\" said Kevin. \"If he figures we can be scared off, he\\'ll land. Otherwise, maybe he\\'ll go away.\" \"Not that little stinker,\" Teejay told him. \"Not Schuyler Barling. He won\\'t go away. Will the fact that we\\'re here first matter? It will not, for Schuyler knows we can\\'t prove it. You ought to know better than to hope for that, Kevin. NOj we can figure that Schuyler will move in on us.\" \"What happens then?\" Steve demanded. Tee jay shrugged her bare, beautiful shoulders. \"That I don\\'t know. Schuyler may be a stinker and may be predictable, but he\\'s not that predictable. Hey, it looks like the Frank Bck is coming down!\" The big ship, Steve saw, was doing precisely that. Its jets had been cut, and the ship fell like a stone. Twice its length separated it from the rubble-strewn pumice when the pilot kicked his jets over again, and something seemed to slap the Frank Buck back up toward the starry sky. The result was a first-rate landing. \"That would be Schuyler showing off,\" said Teejay wearily. \"He must have been born in a tube and weaned on jet-slag, and he sure lets you know it.\" Fifteen minutes later, Schuyler Barling and three of his officers entered the Gordak. Barling got out of his vacsuit first, a tall, handsome man of about thirty, with short-cropped blond hair, pale blue eyes and petulant lips. \"Captain Moore,\" he said, bowing slightly from the waist. Making fun of Teejay. \"Mr. Barling.\" As ever, the woman seemed cool and unruffled. \"With us,\" said Schuyler Barling, \"it\\'s in the family. I work for my father. Obviously, it means something to me whether he succeeds or not. But you, Captain Moore, you\\'re a hired hand. You work for Brody Carmical, on a paycheck. Therefore, your loyalty could not possibly be as strong as mine, and -- \" \"Get to the point!\"  \"We arrived here on Ganymede almost simultaneously. One of us will have to leave.\" \"It didn\\'t look simultaneous to me. Barling ignored her. \"Yes, one will have to leave, because the anthrovac is frightened off easily and unless a hunt is carried on with the utmost precision and timing, no one will catch any anthrovacs.\" \"Go on,\" said Teejay. She spoke quietly, but Steve knew the woman well enough to realize her temper was coming to a boil, inside. \"My Frank Buck got here first,\" Barling told her blandly. \"Therefore, you will leave.\" \"That\\'s a stinking lie!\" Teejay cried. \"We were here first and you know it.\" \"Who can prove it? The Frank BwcA: landed first.\" Barling\\'s hand flashed down to his waist, came up gripping a neutron gun. \"If we have to, we\\'ll force you to leave.\" Teejay stood with hands on hips, facing him. \"I know I\\'m not conducting myself like a lady, but then, this is the twenty-second century,\" she said, smiling -- and struck out with her balled right fist. It bounced off Barling\\'s jaw with savage force and the man stumbled back against the wall and crashed to the floor, his neutron gun clattering away. Barling shook himself, tried to rise. He got to hands and knees, then fell forward on his face. Teejay whirled on his officers. \"All right, get him out of here ! Come on, move.\" T he three men looked at each other. None of them did anything. \"You see, boy?\" said Kevin, grinning. \"That\\'s our Captain and we\\'ll fight for her. She won the beauty pageant five years ago in Cerestown, and she can fight like a man. She\\'s a woman for the stars, and we\\'re proud to -- \" \"Shut up,\" said Teejay. \"That won\\'t get us anywhere.\"  By now, Barling had stirred, had come up, dazed, into a sitting position. He rubbed his jaw, winced. \"Assuming we return to our ship, we still won\\'t leave Ganymede. Not without our anthrovac.\" \"Nor will we.\" \"But you had to hit me! You had to flaunt your -- \"No one told you to draw your gun.\" \" -- flaunt yoiur Amcizonian prowess. \"Stop sniveling, Schuyler. I think we\\'ll have to reach some sort of a compromise, but I\\'ll dictate terms, not you.\" \"Yes?\" Barling growled up at her. \"Who says we\\'ll obey?\" \"Oh, get up ofT the floor! You look so silly, sitting there and rubbing your chin. Barling stood up, retrieving his gun but bolstering it. Kevin watched him, toying with his own weapon -- not pointing it at anyone in particular, but tossing it back and forth idly from hand to hand. \"Give us twenty four hours,\" said Teejay. \"We\\'ll look for our anthrovac. In that time, none of your men is to leave the Frank Buck, After that, you get twenty four hours, and we\\'re confined to the G or dak. Then us, then you. And so on, till one of us gets his anthrovac. Then he pulls out and the other is left here. Is it a deal?\" Barling considered, said: \"Well, yes -- with one change. We get the first twenty four hours.\" \"No.\" \"Then you can forget your deal, Captain Moore.\" \"Well, then let\\'s tos for it.\" Teejay reached into a pocket of her cape, flipped a coin to Steve. \"Here, Stedman. You toss it.\" \"Who gets to call?\" Barling demanded. \"Do you. want to?\" \"Well -- \" , \"Good. Then I will. Ladies first, you know. Go ahead, Stedman.\" Steve tossed the coin, and Teejay cried: \"Heads!\" Palming the coin, Steve flipped it over on the back of his left hand, peered at it. Staring up at him was the metallic likeness of Angus MacNamara, first man to reach the planet Mars. \"Heads,\" said Steve, and one of Barling\\'s officers came over to verify it. Barling shook his head stubbornly. \"How do I know it isn\\'t a phony, a two-headed coin?\" Teejay glared at him. \"That\\'s insulting, Schuyler.\" \"Well, I\\'d like to look at it. How do I know -- \" \"You don\\'t. But I said it\\'s insulting. So, if you want to see the coin, you\\'ll have to fight me!\" \"Never mind,\" said Barling, climbing into his vac-suit. \"You get first try.\" And all of them garbed in their vac-suits once more, the men of the Frank Buck departed. \"Get those beaters out again!\" Teejay was calling into her micro phone, and Kevin grasped Steve\\'s arm said: \"Go ahead) boy. Look at the coin.\" Steve did. It had two heads. And later, Teejay said to him: \"Listen, Stedman. All the beaters are out now, but frankly, I don\\'t trust Schuyler.\" Steve said he did not blame her, and Kevin was there to nod his red head. \"So, Stedman, the beaters have their jobs to do. That\\'s almost everyone. But temporarily at least, it leaves you and Mac here with nothing to do.\" \"That\\'s true,\" said Kevin. \"But not for long, Mac. Schuyler may try something, I don\\'t know what. You two are probably the strongest men on this ship. I know what you can do, Mac -- and I saw a sample of Stedman at work when he had that little run-in with LeGlarc. All right: you two hop into a couple of vac-suits. That is, if Stedman\\'s ready to fight for us if he has to -- \" Steve chuckled, \"I don\\'t go\\' around carrying two-headed coins, Teejay, but I know a rat when I see one. I\\'ll go, and your friend Schuyler better not try anything.\" Almost, he was surprised at his own words. Teejay had a way of commanding respect,, and if he didn\\'t viatch himself, he\\'d be talking like Kevin soon. Well, perhaps the woman merited it... His thoughts took him that far, and then he remembered Charlie. \"Fll go,\" he said again, almost growling. \"But you still have a chip on your shoulder -- well, never mind. I\\'ll expect quarter-hourly reports from you two.\" \"You\\'ll get them,\" said Kevin, and climbed into his vac-suit. self out on the bleak, desolate surface of Ganymede, walking wdth Kevin past the long, silent length of the Frank Buck, And here, outside the confining walls of their spaceship, the Ganymede-fear seemed stronger. Steve felt it as something palpable, clutching at his heart and constricting it, bringing sweat to his forehead and clouding the inside of his helmet with moisture. Fear -- of what? Not of the frontier world itself, surely. Not of some unknown menace lurking out among the craterlets and ringwalls. No, for while Ganymede was not yet as familiar as Mars or Venxis, mankind still had explored it extensively. There were the strange anthrovacs, animals which looked like over-sizec and less brutish gorillas but which were not protoplasm creatures and which took their energy directly from sunlight and cosmic radiation. But that was all -- no other life existed on Ganymede, and the anthrovacs on their frigid, airless world were something of an oddity. Then what caused the fear? And was the fear responsible in any way for what had happened to Charlie? \"Hey, Steve -- snap out of it!\" Kevin\\'s voice, floating in thinly on the intercom. \"Huh? Oh, yeah, Kevin. Sure, It\\'s that fear, sort of gets you out here. You cant help it.\" \\'T know. A ship seems to cut it off to some extent, boy. But it\\'s around, lurking, waiting to get you.\" \"What do you mean, waiting to get )u?\" \"Well, not directly. But it makes you make mistakes. Men have died that way -- paying so much attention to the fear that they didn\\'t pay enough attention to whatever was happening.\" \"Kevin, do you know anything about how Charlie died you haven\\'t told me?\" \"Maybe. Maybe not. It\\'s kind of vague, boy. Teejay went out alone and when she came back -- why, she looked scared. That\\'s common enough on Ganymede -- everyone looks scared. But Teejay looked puzzled and confused also, and that\\'s not like her. She wouldn\\'t talk much for a time, and when she did she just said she\\'d found Charlie Stedman, your brother, dead.\" \"Where?\" \"What do you mean, where? Out here on Ganymede, naturally.\" \"No, I mean exactly where. What was done with the body?\" \"That I don\\'t know,\" said Kevin, and Steve could picture him frowning inside his helmet. \"Well -- listen, Kevin! Do you hear something?\" \"Hear something? How can you hear anything on Ganymede, with no air to carry it? Except on the radio, of course. I hear you, but get a grip on yourself, boy.\" \"No. I hear something. There it is, louder. My God, Kevin! My God -- And clumsily in his vacsuit, Steve began running away acrqss the pumice. \"Hey, come back! Back here you crazy fool -- \" Kevin charged after him, taking long, ungainly strides ,in the light gravity. But Steve was quicker and soon the distance between them increased and Kevin realized he wouldn\\'t be able to overtake Steve at all. \"Gome back! What do you hear, boy? At least tell me that.\" Steve told him, and ran on. mazed, Kevin lumbered back toward the Gordak, \"But what made him do it?\" Teejay demanded, later. \"I told you all I know, Captain. He said he heard something and started running. I chased after him, couldn\\'t catch him. He told me what he heard.\" \"What?\" \"Weil, you won\\'t like this, because it doesn\\'t make sense. But he said he heard his brother -- calling him. Charlie Stedman, calling.\" \"Charlie Stedman is dead.\" Suddenly, Teejay was curt, preemptory. \"That\\'s what I thought, too.\" \"Forget it. It\\'s the Ganymedefear, Mac. Somehow it got to Stedman stronger than it got to most people. Maybe his brother was hit that way, too. Maybe, right now, Stedman is off his rocker, running out across the pumice somewhere, shouting his brother\\'s name into the soundless void of space.\" \"We\\'ll have to find him,\" said Kevin. \"How can we, Mac? He\\'s got air for five or six hours, and Ganymede is big.\" \"I\\'m going to take a set of shoulf der-jets and go looking for him. Captain. I hope you won\\'t try to stop me. I\\'m going either way.\" Shruing, Tee jay went to a cabinet, handed Kevin a pair of shoulder-jets, which he strapped at once to his vacsuit. The woman took another suit and another pair of jets. \"Once I heard voices out here on Ganymede, too,\" she said. \"So did Charlie Stedman. They killed Charlie and they almost killed me. Enough\\'s enough, Mac. I\\'m going with you.\" large. Slowed by his vac-suit, a man might cover its diameter in half an hour. But Steve did not traverse the circular area. Instead, he climbed the ringwall laboriously and then made his way down, tumbling and sliding, to the rocky floor of the shallow crater. The voice came from within it -- from within the crater. It could not be! He told himself that more than once. The rock of Ganymede itself might carry sound, but you\\'d feel it only as a throbbing through the soles of your boots, for the vacuum of space which encroached on all sides could not transmit soundwaves. That was science.\\' That was elementary. But the voipe whispered in his ears, ebbing and flowing, first loud, then soft -- and science be damned. Charlie was calling.  am Charlie Stedman, I am Charlie Stedman -- That was all, but it was enough. Charlie\\'s name, and Charlie\\'s voice. \"It can\\'t be happening,\" Steve said, aloud, and heard his own voice roaring inside the helmet. It drove the other voice, the impossible voice, out for a mornent, but it returned. Around the innercircumference of the ringwall Steve ran, seeking a source for the impossible. Sobbing, stumbling, he plunged ahead. It was only when he returned to his starting point, a needle-like pinnacle of rock, that he realized his supply of air would be exhausted in three hours. \"He couldn\\'t have gone much farther than this, Mac.\" \"We\\'ve got plenty of air. Captain. I\\'m not giving up -- The two figures soared on spurting jets a hundred feet above the surface of Ganymede. When Teejay went higher every few moments, she could barely , make out the two spaceships, far away to the left. Occasionally she saw the beaters working in teams of six, cumbersome tanks of oxygen strapped to their backs. \"Did you hear the voice, Mac?\" \"No.\" \"Had Stedman been drinking?\" \"That\\'s ridiculous. The boy was with us, and you saw for yourself.\" \"True. And I\\'ve said that the voices of Ganymede are no strangers to me, anyway. Maybe I was trying to rationalize.\" \"We\\'ll see when we find Steve.\" \"# we find him. The fear can make you do crazy things out here, Mac. Like going for too long without sufficient oxygen.\" , \"That\\'s what I\\'m worrying about.\" A phonograph needle caught in one groove spinning out its brief message over and over again -- that was the. voice. I am Charlie Stedman. And the ringwall might have been the record, Steve thought bitterly, except that it was utterly deserted. He hadn\\'t covered its entire rock-strewn area; an army of searchers would be necessary to do that. But he had seen enough to convince him that -- The thought fled. Coming toward him over the floor of the ringwall was a huge anthrovac, walking erect with a shuffling gait. Charlie\\'s voice grew louder. \"It\\'s no good, Mac. We can\\'t find him.\" \"As soon as, we turn back he\\'s as good as dead.\" \"Our air won\\'t last forever,\" Teejay said. \"He\\'s got even less.\" \"Ten more minutes?\" \"All right, ten. But why did you come out here with me if you\\'re ready to give up so easy?\" \"Who said I am? I\\'m trying to be practical, Mac. Listen, I saved Stedman\\'s life once already -- and stayed out on the hot side of Mercury longer than a person should, too. I like Stedman, but if we ever find him, better not say that or I\\'ll break your neck, hear? So I want to find him, but I don\\'t want to sacrifice your life or mine in the attempt. Is that clear?\" Kevin said that it was. A moment later, Teejay climbed higher. Half a thousand feet above the surface of Ganymede she circled. Abruptly, she leveled off t a hundred feet again, said: \"There\\'s something over there, Mac. In that ringwall.\" \"What?\" \"I don\\'t know. Movement. A big figure # ind a little one. The big one seems too large for a man, but the smaller -- well,det\\'s go.\" The anthrovac paused a dozen yards from Steve. There had been nothing hostile in its movements to begin with, and now it might have been a statue for all the activity it displayed. From crown of head to small, handlike feet, it stood almost a yard taller than Steve, but it did not have the great-muscled girth of a gorilla. Instead, it looked quite manlike, except for the incredibly broad shoulders, the thick, matted hair covering its entire body, the toolong arms, the nine feet of height. Did the voice emanate from it? Now that the creature had approached him, Steve wasn\\'t sure. The voice continued, pulsing and throbbing in his ears like the Ganymede-fear itself -- hut in his ears. Not from the bleak terrain around him, and certainly not from the anthrovac. \"I\\'m going crazy,\" he said, aloud, driving the voice away temporarily. \"No. No, I\\'m not, because I realize it too soon. A crazy man doesn\\'t realize it and doesn\\'t warn himself, about it -- certainly not at the outset.\" But did that mean the voice had any real existence? How could it? I am Charlie Stedman... Smiling bleakly, Steve picked up a loose chunk of rock, tossed it at the anthrovac. Tlie creature merely swung its huge body gracefully at the hips, avoiding the missile. Ifhen it stooped, found a stone for itself, hurled it at Steve. He ducked, feeling completely and tremendously foolish. He should have been prepared, for the anthrovacs are playful and can mime almost any human action. He did not duck in time. He felf the stone thunk against his helmet, peered with horror at the glassite inches from his face until he saw that it hadn\\'t cracked. Grinning now, he shook his fist at the creature, watched it duplicate the motion with its great hairy hand. It was a game, Steve told himself,  lc#t like the meaningless conversation Teejay and Kevin had had to dispell the Ganymede-fear. But if the anthrovac could mime human actions, perhaps the anthro vac could also mime voices! That would necessitate telepathic powers, naturally. But the anthrovac, like many denizens of terrestrial forests and tundras, changed its habits immensely in captivity. A captured anthrovac, one which had been reared with one of the circus troupes, could never tell you what a wild anthrovac was like. And a wild anthrovac, somehow living on airless Ganymede and taking its energy directly from cosmic and solar radiation, might be able to do anything. I am Charlie Stedman... Steve carried the thought to its logical conclusion. Suppose an anthrovac -- this anthrovac which faced him now -- had somehow heard Charlie speaking. Charlie might have been introducing himself to someone: \"I am Charlie Stedman.\" But the hypothesis wasn\\'t much more than a bubble, and it burst completely when Steve remembered he was the only one who could hear the voice, \"Hey, Stedman! You trying to kill yourself?\" Steve whirled, looked up. Two figures, no more than vaguely human in their cumbersome vac-suits, hovered over him, jetting around in circles. The anthrovac had seen them too -- and now, apparently alarmed by the twin forms floating just out of reach, the creature turned and bounded away over the uneven terrain. \"What gave you that idea?\" Steve called into his intercom. \"The anthrovac wasn\\'t looking for trouble.\" \"I don\\'t mean that, stupid.\" Teejay had a way of jarring him back to reality with a few words. \"I mean, how much air have you left?\" Steve looked at the guge. \"Enough to return to the Gordak, provided I get on my horse.\" \"We\\'ll walk with you, then,\" said Teejay, and dropped to the ground at his side. \"I think I\\'ll hold onto your arm, too. You\\'re liable to go wandering again, and we might not be able to find you.\" Kevin alighted, switched off his jets. \"How about the voice, boy? Do you still hear it?\" \"Why -- no! But I did a minute ago, until the anthrovac ran away.\" \"That\\'s peculiar.\"  \"There\\'s a lot that\\'s peculiar out here on Ganymede, Kevin. I think -- \"Stop thinking and start walking,\" Teejay told him. Less than twa hours later, they reached the Gordak, A vac-suited man met them at the airlock, and Steve saw LeClarc\\'s face through the glassite helmet. \"I\\'ll bet you were worried,\" said Teejay. \"Sure,\" LeClarc answered, drawing a neutron gun from his belt. \"See, my Captain, I\\'m so worried I can hardly think straight. Will the three of you please turn around and march over to the Frank Buckr They were too stunned to do anything else. \"F#N\\'T mind me,\" Kevin JL- said, within the Frank Buck. \"If I\\'m confused it\\'s merely because I can\\'t believe this. Not you, LeClarc, not you.\" They\\'d been ushered into the main lounge of the Frank Buck a ship of about the Gor dak\\'s dimensions, but two or three years older. LeClarc stood there with his neutron gun, watching them carefully. In a few moments, Schuyler Barling joined them, a grealy salve covering the discoloration on his jaw. The jaw looked painfully swollen too, and Barling rubbed it speculatively. \"I won\\'t forget this,\" he growled briefly to Teejay, then turned to LeClarc. \"Kevin McGann I know, but what about this man?\" \"Stedman?\" said LeClarc. \"You\\'ll want him, because he\\'s the extra-zoo man on the Gordak. If you took McGann and the woman alone, they still might be able to do their work on Carmical\\'s ship. But with Stedman your prisoner as well. their hands are tied over there.\" \"What is this?\" Teejay demanded defiantly. \"What\\'s the meaning of -- \" \"Will you be quiet and let me do the talking?\" Barling interrupted her. \"It was LeClarc who radioed and told me your coin had two heads. If you wanted to play the game that way, I wasn\\'t going to stand by and let you. So -- \" \"So,\" LeClarc took up the thread for him, \"we got together, Mr. Barling and I.\" \"But you, LeClarc,\" said Kevin. \"You\\'d jump through a fire-hoop into a pit of acid if Captain Moore told you to.\" \"Would I?\" LeClarc chuckled softly. \"Yes, Yes, you would.\" \"Perhaps there was a time I\\'d have done that, McGann. Perhaps. But then I thought the Captain needed me, and wanted me to help her, too. Now, with you and Stedman -- well, LeClarc isn\\'t so important, is he?\" \"So that\\'s it!\" Kevin roared. \"You\\'re jealous. Not jealous the way a man should be, when he loves a woman, but jealous because you believed Captain Moore had discarded you -- had decided you weren\\'t such an essential cog in the Gordak machine.\" \"Shut up.\" LeClarc took a quick step toward Kevin and hit him, hooking his left fist at the bigger man\\'s jaw. Kevin staggered but did not go down. Bellowing, he charged at LeClarc, but the Frenchman waved him off with the neutron gun. \"Stop it, LeClarc!\" Barling snapped. \"I didn\\'t have you bring them here to make a shambles of the lounge. Just stand off in the corner -- that\\'s right, there -- and watch them. I\\'ll do the talking.\" \"You realize, of course,\" Teejay told him calmly, \"that this is kidnapping.\" \"Is it? Who is to say? You never entered the Gordak; LeClarc met you within the airlock. For all your crew knows, the three of you are out on Ganymede somewhere --  with not much air left. After a time, they\\'ll have to give you up as dead. With the Captain gone, and the Exec, and the expert on Extra-terrestrial zoology -- their expedition won\\'t amount to much. It looks to me like old man Garmical will be without a circus this year, unless he resorts to a strictly terrestrial shindig.\" \"What happens then?\" Teejay wanted to know. \"Well, I\\'ll be frank with you, I haven\\'t decided. I can\\'t simply return you to civilization, of course.\" \"Of course,\" Teejay echoed him acidly. \"Then you\\'d be able to holler \\'kidnapper\\'. It would seem tha#: you give me only one alternative. Ah -- excuse me a moment.\" A trio of men had entered the lounge and the leader, a stocky man of about thirtyfive, was beaming. \"We\\'ve got three,\" he said. \"Splendid, splendid. In that case, nothing remains to keep us on Ganymede.\" \"Chief, I\\'m sure glad of that. This place can give you the heebies, and you never know why. Those three anthrovacs should be a fine core to build your circus around, though,\" \"Three anthrovacs?\" Teejay cried, her composure fading for the first time. \"You\\'ve got three anthrovacs?\" Barling nodded. \"LeClarc here was good enough to tell us Stedman\\'s plan. A first-rate idea, as you can see, only we were able to carry it out. Frankly, I wasn\\'t sq optimistic at first.\" \"Let\\'s get back to us,\" Teejay suggested. \"You were saying...?\" \\' \"Umm-mm, yes. There\\'s only one alternative, and much as I regret -- \" \"What is it? What\\'s the alternative?\" \"Please, must I say it? I thiiik you know, and there\\'s no need for me to -- \" \\' \"No, I want to hear it.\" \"Suit yourself,\" said Barling. \"The only solution is this: we\\'ll have to eliminate you.\" \"When?\" \"The sooner the better. But Captain Moore, you\\'re making me feel -- \" \"That\\'s all I wanted to know!\" Teejay cried, and hurled herself at Barling. \"We might as well try to escape while we still have a chance.\" A fter that, things hap. pened almost too fast for Steve to follow. Kevin got the idea at once, charging at LeClarc before the Frenchman had time to gather his wits. The neutron gun hissed violently, searing a three-inch chunk out of the ceiling. But then LeClarc was struck by two hundred poimds of Kevin McGann, and went down before the onslaught. Something exploded against Steve\\'s jaw and he did a quick flip and landed on his back. He\\'d hardly had time to declare himself in the battle, when one of Barling\\'s men had jumped him. Now the man came down atop him, flailing with both fists, but Steve chopped at his face with short, clubbing blows and scrambled to his feet while the man caught his breath. Steve didn\\'t wait, plunging toward the man with murder in his eyes -- and failed to reach him. An arm circled his neck from behind and he was dragged to the floor again, by the second of the three anthrovac hunters. He rolled over, saw Kevin and LeClarc off to his right, standing toe-to-toe and slugging. And beyond them, Teejay was cuffing Barling around the lounge with lusty, man-sized blows. Barling went down under the onslaught, falling at the woman\\'s feet, but then the third hunter had grasped her swirling black cape from behind, throwing it over her head and tripping her. She fought blindly as she went down, taking the hunter with her; and with Barling, they became a tangled melee of thrashing arms and legs. Steve rolled out from under the second hunter, but the first one met him halfway and pole-axed him down to the floor again with a hard right hand. Sobbing, clutching at the man\\'s legs, Steve began to pull himself upright and got a knee in his face. He went down again, and this time everything in the room receded into a vague, shadowy fog. When Steve could see again, there was still no order to the chaos. He hadn\\'t lived a violent life like Kevin or Teejay -- such things were not part of his background, although he\\'d boxed in college and won the light-heavyweight championship, too. But there was something different, something elemental about a free-for-all brawl. LeClarc lay on his back, supine. He looked out of it for the duration, which still set the odds at four to three against the trio from the Gordak. Right now Kevin held his own with the two hunters who\\'d done Steve in, at least temporarily. But that couldn\\'t last, for both were big, muscular men. And Teejay? She was a woman, so perhaps the-odds were even worse. Steve smiled grimly as he clambered to his feet to help Kevin, Teejay was a woman, but she was the new twentysecond century woman, and proud of it. The third hunter kicked and thrashed helplessly on the floor as she held him in a head-scissors and a the same time fended off Barling-who was crawling around them and looking for an opening. Teejay, definitely, was an asset. Steve got to hunter number three quickly, pulling him off Kevin and straightening him with an uppercut. After that, it was a set-up. Steve pounded once and then again with his left hand at the man\\'s midsection, then finished by crossing his right and feeling it crunch against the man\\'s jaw. \"Now I see how you could take care of LeClarc that first day I\" Kevin yelled, and promptly polished off the other hunter with a blow that lifted him completely off the floor. As one, they whirled around to face the other side of the room. Barling and his henchman had finally got the upper hand. Teejay lay on her side her hands behind her back. Not unconscious, she was completely spent, and an almost equally exhausted Barling was attempting to tie her hands with the black cape. The hunter sat there, dulleyed, watching them. It was Kevin who lifted the hunter and hurled him away, and when Steve rolled Barling over and pushed him against the wall, the man did not resist. Teejay climbed to her feet, unsteadily. T -- guess Tm growingsoft,\" she panted. \"Maybe -- I don\\'t know -- maybe training and muscletoning from -- infancy -- aren\\'t the answer. A gal just isn\\'t cut out for rough and tumble fighting.\" Her hand flashed up to her forehead, the back of it resting against her brow. \"Ooo, Steve, catch me -- She fainted in his arms. Somehow, they got Teejay injo her vac-suit. The walls of the lounge were sound-proofed, and the struggle had attracted no one. Silently they made their way out of the lounge and through the corridors of the Frank Buck heading for the airlock. Steve toted Teejay over his shoulder, and remembering Mercury, felt very good about it. He ached all over from the fight and he knew he\\'d need some mending. But she\\'d called him Steve, and that -- suddenly and ridiculously -- . was most important. \"What\\'s going on here?\" A crewman met them in the corridor and bellowed his challenge. Kevin raised the neutron gun he had taken from LeClatc. He never used it. A fraction of a second later, the Frank Buck blasted off from the surface of Ganymede, and sudden acceleration threw them all to the floor. As Steve was to learn later, no hands were at the controls. No human hands. X nation,\" began Barling, pacing back and forth, speaking out of swollen lips and averting the right side of his face with its puffy cheek and blackened eye. \"We are all in this together, and -- \" \"You hypocrite!\" cried Teejay. \"Six hours ago, you wanted to kill us. Now, because something unexpected pops up, you change yoiu: mind. Temporarily, for as long as you can use us, is that it?\" \"No. If we can get out of this I\\'ll forget about kidnapping.\" \"Well... \"You haven\\'t any other choice. Captain Moore.\" \"He\\'s right,\" Kevin admitted. \"But what\\'s the trouble we\\'re in, Mr. Barling?\" \"Six hour ago you three jumped us and almost made your escape. But the Frank Buck took off; suddenly, without warning. None of my men was at the controls \"That doesn\\'t make sense,\" Steve objected. \"I didn\\'t think so, either. I almost don\\'t know how to explain it, what I\\'ve seen with my own eyes after my men held you in detention here in the lounge.\" \"Why don\\'t you begin at the beginning?\\' Tee jay said, and yawned. \"Don\\'t be funny. Somehow, the anthrovacs escaped from their bubbles and -- \"What?\" This was Steve, more than slightly incredulous. \"Anthrovacs are mild creatures and unless they\\'re attacked they won\\'t do anything violent.\" \"That\\'s what I thought, Stedman, I don\\'t know what to think now. The anthrovacs escaped -- and freed all the other animals. We\\'ve been out longer than the Gordak we have a couple of dozen prize specimens. Lead by the anthrovacs, they\\'ve taken over the ship.\" \"Now you\\'re joking,\" Teejay told him. \"They\\'re all brainless, those creatures, except for the anthrovacs.\" \"They were brainless. Captain Moore. But not now. Now they behave logically, with a purpose, and they\\'ve taken over the Frank Buck from stem to stern -- all except those animals that need a special sort of atmosphere to breathe, and they\\'ve remained in their bubbles. \"Otherwise, the animals took over. And I suppose you can imagine -- the crew was too astounded to resist, especially since the anthrovacs had gotten hold of neutron guns and seerned to know how to use them. Result -- we\\'ve all been disarmed, we\\'re prisoners aboard our own ship, and bound for I don\\'t know where.\" \"Sounds crazy to me,\" Teejay said, and stalked toward the door. Steve took a quick step after her, but Barling held him back. \"Let her find out for herself, Stedman. Then maybe we can talk sense.\" Teejay opened the door, stepped out into the corridor. Tensely, Steve waited, ready to bolt after her at the first indications of trouble. But what he heard was a yelp of surprise from the woman, and then she came running back into the lounge, slamming the door behind her. \"A Martian desert cat I\" she cried. It didn\\'t do anything; it just stood there, all ten feet of it, looking at me!\" \"Then you believe me?\" Barling demanded. \"As I see it, we must have been struck by some cosmic radiation which mutated the animals, and -- \" \"No,\" Steve told him bluntly. \"That\\'s impossible. First place, any such change would have to be selective. All the animals wouldn\\'t be affected. And more important, mutation takes generations to manifest itself. You never see the change at all in the original creature. Look at . Earth, way back in the early years of atomics. Genes were mutated at those two Island cities -- Nagasaki and, umm-mm, I forget the name of the other. Anyway, Genes were mutated, but it took over two hun. dred years for those mutations to become apparent. See what I mean?\" \"I do,\" said Barling. \"And that\\'s precisely why I think we ought to fight this thing together. I had an idea, you helped me with it. We can continue like that.\" \"Well,\" Steve nodded, \"we have \"a first-class problem on our hands. We can\\'t do anything about it until We know what\\'s going on -- only the mystery\\'s a little deeper than you think. First, I heard a voice out on Ganymede. My brother\\'s voice.\" \"Your brother\\'s?\" Barling scratched his head, \"Oh, wait a minute! You must mean Charlie Stedman who was killed out here a few years back?\" \"Yeah, Charlie. You can\\'t hear voices on Ganymiede, but I heard them, inside my head. Also, don\\'t  forget the Ganymede-fear. I\\'d say the three things will fit together when we begin to learn what\\'s going on.\" \"Provided we can find out,\" Teejay told him. \"You can keep your scientific mysteries for a while, Steve. What I want to know is this: where are we going, and why?\" \"Ask your desert cat out there.\" Kevin\\'s laughter was sour. \"What we need is a good turn coat,\" Tee jay assured him. \"Someone who can go out among the animals and ask questions. I\\'m joking, of course, but if anyoi) could do it, it would be that Tat, LeClarc.\" Steve frowned. \"That\\'s not as funny as it sounds. Has anyone seen LeClarc since the fight?\" \"No!\" Kevin slammed fist against palm. , Steve was about to answer, but quite suddenly the lights blinked out. Somewhere outside, a dozen animals roared their fear. Within the lounge, Kevin commenced cursing lustily and an involuntary moan escaped Barling\\'s lips. The darkness was the bleak, utter  black of deep space. Further, Steve realized, the steady humming of the fission engines had erased. Minutes later, impossible pain gripped him and flung him, sobbing to the floor. He\\'d never felt anything like it, a gripping, grinding, twisting torment which tried to turn him inside out. He heard the others dimly, reeling about the lounge and falling to the floor, and in the darkness someone fell near him. \"Steve? Steve, is that you?\" Teejay... \"Yeah.\" The pain seemed to come in waves, and Steve gritted his teeth when the second turned out to be worse than the first. He reached out with his hand, found Teejay\\'s and squeezed it. \"Hold on, kid. It can\\'t last forever.\" \"It better -- not.\" When her hand tensed in his, then relaxed, Steve knew she\\'d fainted. And soon after that, his own senses reeled and deserted him. Teejay\\'s hand was still tightly clenched in his when he regained consciousness. A dozen feet from them, Kevin sat up, shaking his head slowly back and forth. Schuyler Barling lay stretched out on his stomach. \"Whatever happened,\" Kevin growled, \"I didn\\'t like it.\" Tee jay extricated her hand, looked at Steve, smiled. \"It\\'s still awful quiet outside.\" It didn\\'t remain that way for long. As if Teejay\\'s words had been a signal, a voice boomed at them from the wall-rnicrophone. \"We have landed. All humans will please file out into the main corridor in an orderly fashion and make their way to the airlock.\" Schuyler Barling sat up groggily. Tee jay said, \"I could swear I know that voice from somewhere. \"And I,\" Kevin told them. \"It\\'s familiar, though I can\\'t place it.\" Steve felt his heart pounding. The voice was Charlie\\'s. T hey stood on a flat, grassy plain which stretched halfway to the horizon and then began to undulate into low hills. And far off, shrouded by purple mists, a range of mountains loomed distantly. Purple mist; a purplish cast to the sky; a fiercely bright blue sun. \"What world is this?\" said Kevin. The crew of the Frank Buck -- a hundred men -- stood in a long, thin file outside the ship. They\\'d balked at first, but silently, the three anthrovacs had ferreted them out with their neutron guns, never uttering a sound, merely motioning with the weapons. Of the other animals Steve saw nothing, but within the corridors of the Frank Buck he\\'d encountered a sand crawler and a desert cat, both dead. The seconds fled, became rninutes. When half an hour had passed, the crew became restless and some of them ambled off on the grassy plain until one of the anthrovacs herded them back. The Frank Buck Exec, a short, wiry man, strode within the ship and came out a few moments later, scratching his head. \"I can\\'t understand it,\" he said. \"None of the instruments work. I thought we could just pile back into the ship and blast off, but apparently someone has other ideas.\" Someone did. Someone came striding across the plain, a small dot of a figure at first. He came closer. Steve ignored the anthrovacs, ran forward. \"Charlie!\" he cried. \"Charlie!\" The man was shorter\\' than Steve, and stockier. His eyes searched Steve\\'s face briefly, and he said: \"Should I know you?\" \"Should you! I\\'m your brother!\" \"Interesting, but quite impossible.\" The words hardly registered, and Steve babbled on, \"We thought you were dead. It was Tee jay here who reported back to Earth saying you\\'d died on Ganymede. Now you\\'re alive and -- \" Abruptly he whirled, turned to Teejay. \"You lied, damn you! Here\\'s Charlie, see? Charlie was never dead. But you said -- \" \"I said Charlie was dead.\" The woman met his gaze levelly. \"He was. I know a dead man when I see one. He was dead.\" \"But -- \" \"But nothing. I don\\'t\\' know who this is. I can\\'t explain it. That has nothing to do with what happened on Ganymede years ago.\" \"Yes? Then what did happen? Why did Charlie write once that you must have been spawned in hell? You never did want to tell me what happened on Ganymede, did you? Maybe Charlie can.\" \"That is my name, Charlie Stedman. It is the name this body has always had, although when I do not inhabit it I assure you I am not Charlie Stedman,\" the stocky man said. \"You see, the original inhabitant of the garment -- the body -- was destroyed. The name applied to the body as well as the inhabiting mind. The language remained engraved in the brain cells, and impersonal parts of the memory, too. In that sense, I am Charlie Stedman. Does it satisfy you?\" \"Hell, no,\" said Steve, bewildered. Mystery had been piled upon mystery, with no solution in sight And grim confusion turned to grimmer anger as he faced Tee jay once more. \"All right, strt talking. Just how did you find Charlie? And what made him hate you like that? Talk, damn you!\" \"Okay, I will. But I don\\'t know why Charlie hated me, and that\\'s the truth. I only met him once or twice and -- unless it was Schuyler here. Hey, Schuyler!\" Barling joined them. \"Wlat do you want?!\\' \"Answer this question: do you make a practise of poisoning the minds of your crew against me?\" \"Well, I don\\'t know what you mean by poi -- \" Teejay grabbed a handful of his shirt and twisted, constricting the collar about his throat. \"Answer me,\" she said. \"And no run around.\" \"I -- I guess so. It\\'s only business. Captain Moore. The more they hated you, the more they\\'d be willing to fight you in the hunt every step of the way.\" \"How about Charlie Stedman?\" \"I don\\'t remember. Probably, it was like that.\" Teejay flung him away from her. \"Does that satisfy you, Steve?\" \"For that part, yes. But what about the rest of it?\" \"Not much to tell. I was out alone on Ganymede, a few miles from the ship. I thought I heard voices, sort of inside my head. I went forward to explore, just like you did, and also like you, I almost didn\\'t have enough air to get back. Especially since I found your brother on the way.\" \"And he was dead?\" As he spoke, Steve looked at his brother, standing right there in front of him, and wondered if anyone ever asked a more impossible question. \"Yes. He was dead. I don\\'t know how he died, but I placed my ear against the chest of his vac-suit. The heart-beat is amplified through it, you know. But there wasn\\'t any. After that, I ran back to the Gordak, and I had barely enough air to make it. I reported Charlie\\'s death, of course.\" Charlie\\'s death. Well, she sounded sincere. But there was Charlie, standing two paces to her right and apparently listening to an account of his own demise, a throat. Quite evidently, it \\' wasn\\'t Charlie at all, but Steve could think of the man in no other way, for down to the smallest physical detail, he was Charlie. \"That will suffice,\" he said. Again, it was Charlie\\'s voice, but expressionless. \"Enough of bickering. You will all march with me toward those hills, and We have a long journey before sunset.\" The nine-foot anthrovacs took up their positions one on each side of the column and one behind it, and no one disobeyed. Once Steve looked back over his shoulder and saw the purple mists had almost completely swallowed the Frank Buck. Then the irony of the situation struck Steve and he smiled -- almost. He\\'d come to Ganymede after anthrovacs. But he\\'d left the satellite under an anthrovac guard! Fine thing. A mighty hunter was he! Clear across the universe to be bagged by his own game! Obviously, Steve thought as they marched on, the blue day-star was not Earth\\'s stm. Somehow, in a matter of moments, they\\'d left the Solar System entirely. He knew that theories had been advanced about traveling through something called sub-space, something which could make flight to the farthest stars almost instantaneous, since sub-space existed outside the space-time continuum. And that wrenching from one spatial plane to another might explain the tremendous pain they\\'d undergone, too. But surely the Frank Buck had never been equipped for such flight. The whole concept of sub-space flight was strictly theoretical and hadn\\'t even reached the drawing-board stage. Then how had it happened? Kevin had some vague, halfformed ideas on the subject, and he letSteve know about them. \"It\\'s a puzzler, boy. They took us a long way, space alone knows how far. I don\\'t pretend to know why; we can\\'t figure that out, not yet. But I know this : they could not have done that without help. Someone had to bring the ship.\" \"The anthrovacs?\" Steve suggested. \"Not the anthrovacs. For all their handling neutron guns and taking the Frank Buck over, they\\'re just big apes to me. Maybe they were able to take the ship off Ganymede, but no more than that. They had help, boy, and from the inside \"Who? Who do you mean?\" \"I\\'m not sure I know. But look at it this way. The Gordak wasn\\'t taken, the Frank was. Why? I\\'ll tell you why, or at least I\\'ll tell you one possibility, There were scores of men on each ship, but while the Gordak had only one animal -- the stone worm you got on Mercury -- the Frank Buck had dozens. All right so far, boy? Well, here\\'s what I think: whoever took the ship wanted both men and ani , mals \"I still don\\'t understand.\" \"I\\'m not sure I do, either. Let\\'s get back a little.\\' The Frank Buck, not the Gordak, was taken. Strange, isn\\'t it, that just before that happened LeClarc bolted our ranks and joined the enemy! Does that mean LeClarc had to be on the Frank Buck before anything happened? And whcre\\'d he get to, anyway? I haven\\'t seen him since the fight ; I don\\'t think anyone has. Now, a man spends years idolizing a woman -- I\\'ve been around, and I think I told you LeClarc would have done anything for Captain Moore. Suddenly, he gets sulky because he\\'s out of favor with her, and decides on a double-cross. \"It smells bad, boy. Sure, he was sulky, but the LeClarc I knew would have come crawling to Captain Moore, anyway. This one didn\\'t.\" Kevin paused, ran a hand through his red hair. \"Maybe it means he isn\\'t the same man. Maybe it means he\\'s something like that thing which calls itself your brother. That\\'s not Charlie Stedrnan and you know it. Trouble is, boy, you can\\'t admit it to yourself.\" \"I won\\'t argue about it,\" Steve replied. \"But you\\'re off the beam there. Charlie doesn\\'t remember me, but LeClarc\\'s memory seemed fine.\" \"That\\'s true, Steve. I can\\'t explain it, except like this: whatever happened to both of them, we don\\'t know a thing about it. Maybe it works in a different way on differ ent people. Maybe because Charlie was dead first, his personal memories were a loss, but LeClarc\\'s weren\\'t because he might have been possessed alive.\" \"Possessed?\" \"Yes, possessed. Oh, not by spirits, that\\'s for sure. But possessed nevertheless. I won\\'t say the anthrovacs were possessed, for we don\\'t know enough about them to begin with. But look at those other animals now, the ones that died. You won\\'t deny that something took over their brains?\" \"Damned right I won\\'t. But I still don\\'t see how it all adds up.\" \"Nor do I,\" said Kevin. \"Unfortunately, the brutes seemed to have perished in transit from Ganymede to here, wherever here is. It could be that the strain on their brain-tissue, with sentience and intelligence taking over where before only sentience had resided, was too great.\" Kevin paused, then concluded: \"whatever the reason, whatever the reason for alLof it -- I think you\\'ll find LeClarc knows all about it.\" The blue sun had neared the horizon and the purple mists had ney\\'s end. It was then that they saw LeClarc. T he column of men had traversed the grassy plain, had climbed steadily through the region of undulating hills. And suddenly, hidden until the last moment by a rise in the terrain and spread out at the foot of the higher mountains, they saw a city. Circular, walled, pleasantly pastel-tinted despite the purple gloom, it lay before them, lights which might or might not have been electricity winking on to dispel the gathering darkness. And there, at the city\\'s gateway, stood LeClarc. LeClarc -- and not LeClarc, The man seemed as much LeClarc as the short stocky figure who led the procession seemed Charlie ) Stedraan. \"Welcome to Uashalume,\" he said, and Steve pulled up short at the sound of his voice. There was something of the volatile Frenchman in it, but something else which was alien. \"You will be billeted in temporary quarters for the night,\" LeClarc continued. \"You will of course have no need for such quarters after tomorrow\\'s bazaar.\" \"Of course, my foot!\" Teejay cried petulantly. \"See here, LeClarc, we\\'ve been getting orders and directives without knowing what they mean or why they were given or -- \"Must you be so impatient?\" LeClarc\\'s smile was almost devoid of mirth. \"You\\'ve come one hxmdred thousand light years, and surely you can wait until morning.\" \"Light years!\" This was Steve. And Kevin, \"One hundred thousand!\" The academic problem didn\\'t bother Teejay as much as the human one. She said, defiantly, \"What he needs is a good swift kick.\" LeClarc failed to wait for that, or anything else. Chuckling, he led the first anthrovac through the higharched stone gateway and the other two creatures herded the humans in after him. Charlie -- although obviously, the man was not Charlie -- went on ahead with LeClarc, and Steve had to restrain Teejay with a few terse words. The purple mists cloaked the city completely now, and as they plodded along a wide roadway, Steve half-saw figures watching them from the darkness. He could not make the figures out, however, and he heard nothing but the sounds their feet made on the stone roadway. Presently, they came to a smaller, divergent path which led back to the base of the wall. Here, in deepest shadow, was their destination -- a squat, rectangular building carved from stone. A gate creaked and clanged open before them; they streamed through, weary after hours of forced mardi; the gate clanged resoundingly behind them. Charlie tad not entered with them, nor LeClarc, nor the anthrovacs. It took Steve only a moment to discover the gate had been securely fastened from the outside. \"I guess we bed down here for the night,\" he said, grinning ruefully. Teejay shrugged, wrapped the black cape tightly about her. It was cold and damp in the one large chamber which took up the interior of the building. In the center of the place stood a stone table, and on it a gas lamp which flickered and spluttered and cast grotesque shadows as the men wandered about. There were no beds, no furniture of any sort except for the table. And the two small peep-hole windows were fifteen or more feet off the ground. The crew of the Frank Buck gathered in small, anxious knots and whispered grimly among themselves. After a time, men circulated between one group and another, and finally one of them, evidently designated as spokesman for the rest, approached Schuyler Barling. He seemed nervous, frightened, unsure of himself. \"Captain Barling, my name\\'s Steiner, and the  fellows thought that -- well, that I might speak for them. We don\\'t know what\\'s going on, but we do know this much: we don\\'t like it.\" \"I can\\'t blame you,\" said Barling. \"Point is, sir, we want you to do something about it.\" \"Eh? Me? What can I do?\" \"We don\\'t know that, sir. But a spaceman\\'s a peculiar individual; some say he\\'s got characteristics you won\\'t find elsewhere, and one of them is this : he has complete confidence in his captain.\" \"Why, thank you, Steiner.\" \"Me, I work in fission. I like to have that confidence and the rest of the men, they like to have it too. When they lose it, they\\'re kind of at a loss. We don\\'t want to think we\\'ve lost it here, sir.\" \"What do you want me to do?\" Barling was restless, .fidgety, twisting his hands together, \"Lead us, sir. Tell us you can get us out of here. Tell us we must be prepared to fight behind you and maybe to die, but lead us.\" \"But how can you expect me to lead you when I don\\'t know what\\'s happening? How can I plan for escape when I don\\'t know what it is we have to escape from?\" \"There\\'s talk among the mfen, sir,\" Steiner wfeiit on, \"Some of them are for you, although V be frank. There aren\\'t many, sir. But they need a leader, all of them agree on that. What they want to know IS this: are you their man?\" Barling squared his thin shoulders arrogantly. \"Tm the Frank Bucks Captain.\" \"The Frank Buck lies behind u in those purple mists, sir. Could you find it? Finding it, OOuld yOU make it run again?\" \"I dont know.\" \"Then the fact that you captain the Frank Buck doesn\\'t mean much. We\\'ve decided that leaves us without a leader, sir. We need a leader.\" Barling smiled coldly. \"Are you trying to tell me the men have selected you?\" \"No, sir. I\\'m not. But the \"majority of the men have their choice -- and that is Captain Moore. We who have been with the Frank Buck longest have heard a\\' lot of bad talk about Captain Moore, but that changes completely whenever we make planetfall. The talk in all the frontier towns is all in Captain Moore\\'s favor. When there are decisions to be made, sir, we\\'d like her to make them.\" \"A woman? When all your lives may be at stake?\" who\\'d fared SO poorly in the lounge fight strode forward, saying: \"Look at yourself, sir. You\\'re beaten and battered, and that\\'s Captain Moore\\'s work. Did her sex matter then?\" Barling reddened, said nothing. \"We have a pressing need for a leader,\" Steiner continued. \"Our behavior cannot be chaotic. The leader must plan for us, and we must be prepared to carry out those plans with no hesitation. We must have faith in our leader.\" Tee jay joined them, grinning. \"Thank you, Mr. Steiner. There was a time not long ago when what you\\'ve just finished saying would have meant more to me than anything. Literally, more than anything. But would you\\' think it strange if you hear that I don\\'t think that now?\" \"What do you mean?\" Steiner demanded. \"I\\'m a \\' twenty-second century female, strong as a man and proud of it. Too proud, Mr. Steiner, for I\\'ve spent my whole life trying to prove it. Plenty of men have cursed me for it, I\\'ll bet, and I guess they were right. \"So I don\\'t want that job you offer. It took a kind of free-for-all brawl to make me realize it, but a woman\\'s still a woman, and that\\'s One thing I had to learn. I fought your Captain Barling and I beat him. Probably, I could do it againy But I -- well, I was fighting with Captain Barling and saying to myself all tlie time, \\'This is stupid. What are you -- a girl-- -- doing this for? Don\\'t you know you shouldn\\'t go around fighting like a man?\\' \" Steve noticed in the dim light that Teejay had begun to blush. \"I hate to bate my life before you like this, Mr. Steiner, but the way it adds up I\\'ve suddenly found Tve had enough of fighting and galavanting around. So the answer is no: I won\\'t be your captain. The way I feel now, I can\\'t be.\" \"Where does that leave us?\" Steiner asked her sullenly. \"We don\\'t think Captain Barling can do the job, whatever the job turns out to be. It\\'s one thing to serve on a largely automatic ship under Captain Barling, but another thing to have to take his orders here -- wherever we are.\" \"May I make a Suggestion?\" Tee jay asked. And, after Steiner nodded and most of the men grumbled their assent: \"There are two men here who can lead us the way we should be led. One is Kevin McCann, Exec of the Gordak; the other is Steve Stedman.\" A stir of surprise passed among the men. It was one thing to offer their allegiance to the Captain of another ship -- and an unusual thing at that -- but quite another to offer it to a couple of men they hardly knew. The men began heated discussions once more, louder this time, and Teejay drew Steve off into a comer. \"Does that surprise you?\" \"It sure does, Teejay. On both counts. But I\\'ll tell you this : I think I could like you a lot better in your new role, and -- Teejay?\" \"What?\" Hr voice was soft and he felt her hand snuggle into his. \"I -- I like you plenty right now.\" He slid his arms around her waist, drew her toward him, one small part of his mind expecting a roundhouse right-handed wallop from the old Teejay. But she merely sighed contentedly and slipped her arms, around his neck. He kissed her -- tentatively at first -- then long and deep, and Teejay\\'s eyes were all aglow when he finished. \"You lug,\" she said, \"if you didn\\'t do something like that, and soon, I was going to be an Amazon just once more to make you do it.\" Someone -- Steve saw it was Steiner -- stood before them clearing his throat. \"Captain Moore?\" \"Yes?\" Teejay hardly saw him. \"The men have decided to accept your recommendation. McCann antd Stedman it is. Captain Moore. They bark and we\\'ll jump. And we\\'ll be hoping something comes of it.\" \"If it\\'s at all possible, they\\'ll get us out of here,\" Teejay predicted, and squeezed Steve\\'s hand. \"Any orders, sir?\" Steiner looked at Steve. \"Umm-mm, no. Except that we\\'d like to have this corner to ourselves for a while.\"  \"Done,\" said Steiner, smiling and striding away. \"I have one order,\" Kevin called out loudly, and silence fell on the room quite abruptly. \"Let\\'s all get the hell to sleep before we\\'re too tired to do anything when morning comes.\" in through the two small windows, bringing strange bird-sounds with it. Steve was stiff and chilled and he\\'d slept badly on the hard stone floor. The groans and frowns all around the room showed him he wasn\\'t the only one. Teejay slept like a baby, the cape wrapped about her, and she didn\\'t arise until one of the men began to bang on the ktone and metal door. \"Is it morning?\" said Teejay, coming into Steve\\'s aims almost before she was fully awake. \"I had the nicest dreams darling!\" Abruptly, Steve whirled away from her. The door had begun to creak in ponderously on little-used hinges. An anthrovac bent and came within the chamber, bearing a bath-tub-sized bowl of what looked like hot, steaming cereal. It was deposited near the table, along with a dozen or so stone spoons. Foolishly, one of the men darted for the doorway. Reaching out with a long, hairy arm, the anthrovac scooped him up by the scruff of the neck and flung him back inside. He got to his feet with a nasty gash on his  forehead which Teejay bandaged with a strip of cloth ripped from the hem of her black cape. The spoons were passed around after that, and the men of the Frank Buck dug into the gruel with gustof It had been fifteen hours since any of them had eaten and surprisingly, the gruel turned out to be quite palatable, with an appealing, nutlike flavor. The anthrovac waited fifteen minutes, then lifted the huge bowl and departed with it. But the door didn\\'t close fully. Charlie Stedman came through it. \"Good morning,\" he said. \"We\\'re a little late, and we\\'ll have to hurry if we want to reach the bazaar in time for opening.\" \"Are you sure We want to?\" Kevin demanded sarcastically. And Steiner suggested: \"Maybe you\\'d like to answer a few questions first.\" \"Sure.\" This was Teejay. \"About a thousand questions.\" It was as if the man hadn\\'t heard them at all. \"Outside a vehicle awaits you. There is room for all, provided each man occupies qne of the squares you will find marked off on the floor. Let\\'s go.\" Angry, sullen, but still thoroughly bewildered, the men trooped outside. The, vehicle was a sort of bus, although the noise of a gasoline engine or the purring of a fission engine wpuld have shocked Steve here on the world called Uashalume. As it turned out, the bus started with a whining whistle which quickly climbed to the super sortie and faded beyond the level human ears could reach. Within the Vehicle there were no seats, but the floor had been divided into tworfoot squares, a thin white line marking off each box. When each man had occupied his square, the bus slipped away from the Squat building and was soon streaking down the roadway at a good clip. Steve saw other buildings, most of them squat and shapeless. And now, with the coming of daylight, he could see some of the inhabitants of Uashalume. He\\'d steeled himself for it. He hadn\\'t expected human beings. Any variety of six-legged, multi-tentacled, bug-eyed creatures would have been strictly in order. He gasped. He got more than he bargained for. Hardly two of the creatures gazing in at them were alike! The differences were not those you might expect to find among the members of a particular species. The differences were extreme, A furry thing hovered alongside the openwindowed \\'bus on six gauzelike wings.  Multiple eyes stared up at them out of a pool of amorphous protoplasm. A bony, stickdike creature with four arms and one Cyclopean eye covering almost its entire head peered at them. An ecto-skeletoned monstrosity made clicking noises as they passed. Big horrors and little horrors. Steve found himself laughing harshly. What did all his knowledge of Extra-terrestrial zoology amount to now? Extra-terrestrial -- that meant the Solar System, one tiny, inconsequential corner of a great galaxy. But here, here on Uashalume, denizens of a hundred Solar Systems might have been gathered. Why? Such utterly different creatures -- each conforming to a particular environmental niche -- would not be found together. Unless someone had probed the depths of space for life-forms that might all be capable of surviving bn Uashalume, as, indeed, humans could survive there! But why? The question returned, taunted him. Again, such a gathering wouldn\\'t be out of direct choice. If each of the creatures seemed so completely strange, so horrible, so ludicrous to human eyes -- they probably appeared that way to one another as well. Steve wondered how some of them might describe the obnoxious, featherless, hairless bipeds which walked upright on two limbs and carried two other limbs for more varied purposes than walking. Bipeds which called themselves humans. And that, precisely, was the point. Such a gathering stemmed from no natural cause. Such a gathering had been imposed arbitrarily, but for what purpose? And what, if anything, did the bazaar have to do with it? A bazaar of the worlds, bringing together for trade, creatures of every form and size and color? Steve doubted that somehow, for the bazaar would lack a universal means of exchange, and even if barter were resorted to, how could totally alien life-forms assess the value of completely foreign produce? They couldn\\'t. That left Steve with nothing but a lot of half-formed questions and .no answers at all. He had a hunch he\\'d begin to get some answers when the bus reached its destination. As with the inhabitants of Uashalume, he was to get more than he bargained for. fusion on a large raised platform under the blue sun. A sea of impossible creatures rolled and seethed on all sides of tliem, shuttereyes, pin-hole eyes, simple lightsensative receptors, multiple-tube eyes -- hundreds of varieties all intent upon them. Steve heard voices around him on the platform, confused, alarmed. \"What\\'s happening?\" \"This place looks like an auction block!\" \"Look at those creatures, will you?\" \"Are we for sale or something?\" The human voices faded into a meaningless babble. Someone else was speaking, but not aloud. It was like Charlie Stedman\\'s voice, that day on Ganymede. Steve heard it inside his head and this time -- because they all stood about more bewildered than ever -- he knew that the Frank Buck\\'s crew heard it too. \"Friends of Uashalume,\" the voice purred mentally, \"here, at opening day of the bazaar, we have a most unusual treat. Most unusual. Two of us, as you know, have already tested the models in question, and we find them entirely satisfactory.\" Charlie Stedman and LeClarc stepped forward, bowed. \"For the rest of you, one hundred choice specimens! We set no fixed price, but let this be said about the new garments. They are unspoiled, virgin material; they\\'ve not been used-before. You\\'ll find them stimulating for that reason alone, Fm sure. As for the vital statistics, they vary in height from three and a half to five klars; in weight from fifteen to twenty-nine jarons; they are a bisexual lot, although only one female of the species is present; their intellectual capacity is on the seventh level, their better minds can attain to problems of relativity and universal field ; emotionally, they have twice the range of any previous garment!\" The voice paused significantly, permitted that point to sink in. \"Yes, twice the range. We none of us have ever experienced such strong, vital  emotions. Can you imagine, twice the emotional range means a new way of life for those among us who select some of these humans for their own. \"Now, the auction-master will please step forward.\" \"We are for sale,\" Steiner gasped. It was Charlie Stedman who came to the fore, climbing the auction-block and looking around him. After a time, he singled out Steiner and pulled the man forward by an elbow. \"The first specimen is typical,\" he droned in English, and Steve figured he spoke mentally to the assembled throngs, reeling off the hdght, weight, and other vital statistics for Steiner. Finally: \"What am I bid?\" Mental voices sang out, one after another: \"Three char!\" \"Four.\" \"Six.\" \"Ten char.\" \"Ten?\" The man who was Chai lie Stedman laughed. \"Ten char indeed! One hundred is not enough.\" The bidding continued, became hot, became a contest between two mental voices. Steiner went for seventy-four char, whatever a char was. They took him down and carted him away, struggling. It looked like an ugly scene would develpp, for a score of men surged toward the front of the block angrily. But some of the creatures held what looked like strange, possibly lethal weapons, and Kevin growled: \"Not now! There\\'s no sense getting all of us killed. Relax, and we\\'ll see.\" Grumbling, the men subsided, and Kevin turned to Steve: \"If this isn\\'t the damndest cosmic joke of all.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"We\\'re hunters, big game hunters. We go out into space to hunt for specimens, only this time we\\'ve become specimens ourselves! This time we werent the hunters, but the quarry!\" The auction continued, and one by one the men were sold. Once one of them, a radar technician, bolted and ran. He was cut down quite efficiently by one of the handweapons and Charlie Stedman asserted it was a pity one of the specimens had been lost. \"Keep your tempers,\\' Kevin said grimly as a wave of anger washed over the auction block. \"I dont like it any more than you do, but we won\\'t fight until we understand -- and then perhaps we\\'ll have a chance.\" been taken, Charlie Stedman reached for Teejay and dragged her forward. \"This,\\' he said, \"is the female of the species. You will notice the long hair atop her head and the twin out-thrust developments of the upper ventral region; these are the marks of distinction. And for two reasons we will demand a special price for the female. \"First, we are primarily interested in these humans for emotion. Stronger garments we have, and garments which live longer. But none attain to the human emotional level. And, among the humane, the female is capable of stronger surges of emotion, perhaps because in general she is physically weaker and must compensate for it, although, from what I\\'ve seen, this particular specimen is a physical match for the others. \"Second, one specific high degree of emotion is possible only when a male and a female are in one another\\'s presence. Therefore, whichever one of you owns the female can be certain of that added stimulus, and, as a consequence, certain of a more satisfactory garment from the emotional point of view. Now, what am I offered?\" Teejay went for three hundred chat, Kevin had to circle Steve\\'s body with his huge arms and hold him firm as they took Teejay away. He\\'d found the woman quite suddenly, and he loved her all the more for it. His potential worst enemy had become his lover. And now, brief hours later she was taken from him, perhaps forever. \"Let go of me! Get ydur filthy hands off me. That\\'s Teejay they\\'re taking! Teejay!\" \"And they\\'ll take you too. But you\\'re going alive, not dead. Stand still and let them get on with this.\" \"Don\\'t you realize what they\\'ve been talking about?\" Steve shouted his rage. \"They\\'ll wear Us, like clothing. They\\'ll get inside our brains and share oUf bodies with us, like they\\'ve done with all these other creatures. Did you think these monsters were all native to Uashalume? I wouldn\\'t be surprised if none of them was. They\\'ve all been taken, as we have, from their own worlds. They all live hqre-as clothing. Maybe the masters don\\'t have physical form at all, maybe they\\'re just mental essence. \"And all they want to do is run the gamut of our emotions. They know how to play with emotions, too. Remember the Ganymede-fear, Kevin?\" \"I remember, boy.\" Kevin still held him. \"Well, that was their work. Probably, Ganymede was their base in our Solar System, although it\\'s possible they first got into LeClarc\\'s brain on Mercury. And Kevin, all those theories you had were right!\" \"Yes, I know. And sub-space -- \" \"The hell with that. They\\'re taking Tee jay and they may take all of us and spread us out all over the face of this world. We\\'ll never find each other. We\\'ll -- \" \"You\\'re next, Steve Stedman.\" It was Charlie\\'s voice, and Steve felt Kevin release him with a word of warning, felt himself drawn to the front of the block. Somehow, he found he was incredibly objective as the bidding began. He was claimed for one hundred fifty char and led away by a creature with a stilt-like body and six arms. Or rather, he thought, that was the garment. But the real creature -- the mental entity within it -- had grown tired of last year\\'s cloak, and Steve was to take its place. Moments later, Steve\\'s buyer whisked him away in a smaller version of the bus that had taken the Frank Bucks\\'s crew to the bazaar. On the outskirts of the city, the car stopped. Steve climbed out, followed the stilt-figure up a flight of stairs as a round, fat, furry creature bounced up behind him with a weapon. \\' Inside, the place looked like a laboratory. And at the center of the room squatted a great round tank, large enough to hold a man. A green liquid boiled within it, but somehow Steve got the impression of boiling without much heat. He became absorbed in the idea, reached up over the lip of the tank to verify it on a thoroughly peculiar impulse. Something struck him from behind. He staggered to his knees and tried to keep his eyes opened. The hard stone floor slammed against his face as he lost consciousness. could see again, a murky green haze surrounded him. Floating, completely submerged! He felt no desire to breathe. He did not have to breathe at all. It was as if his life had been suspended completely, as if there was no need for his body to carry out its normal functions. But he wasn\\'t dead. He could open his eyes and stare at the green \\'liquid, and he could think. And after a time, vague forms appeared outside. He saw the walls of the laboratory and the shining instruments -- through green murk. And he saw something else moving about, a shadowy form. The stiltlike creature? Abruptly, sharp pain lanced from the front of his skull to the back. Briefly. And it did not repeat itself. A voice whispered, \"You are struggling. t)o not struggle, for it can only prolong the inevitable. Transfer tsdces time, of course; but the longer it takes the more unpleasant it will be for you.\" \"Go to hell.\" It was then that the pain came back -- stronger. And something almost physical pushed in at his mind, something ugly, unclean, wet with brought twinges of fright. Like the Ganymede-fear but more intense. \"To struggle is useless.\" \\' The wet feeling, like fingers now, fingers which oozed slime, clung to his brain, probed it, bore inward. \"Why struggle? I think you will make a good fit.\" \"Go away. Damn you, go away!\" \"I see the auction-master was right. Emotionally, you are strong.\" The fingers departed, came back again, more insistent. No longer wet, they were digits of fire now, burning, burning. Steve screamed soundlessly and fainted. When Steve came to, he was outside the tank. He was tired and did not feel like walking. Nevertheless,  he walked. At first he did not understand. He thought: I will sit down and rest. His body failed to obey, continued walking. \"We share this body,\" the voice Whispered to him, within his skull. \"You are merely an observer as long as I am awake. I am in control. Henceforth, I dwell in this body.\" \"I want to sleep.\" \"You will learn that your mind can sleep while your body does not. And the body interests me, human. The body is capable of strong emotion. I want to feel that emotion.\" The place, Steve realized later, was a sort of proving-grounds. He felt himself walking, walking. He reached the edge of a cliff, stared down from giddy heights. He felt himself tetering on the edge, saw jagged rocks far below him. He jumped. He did not want to, but he jumped. \"We\\'ll be killed!\" he cried, iey fear making his heart pound. \"That is fear,\" said the voice in his skull. \"That is wonderful fear. So strong -- \" Something cushioned their fall, slowly. It was that, Steve knew. Their fall, not his alone. Eor the creature shared it with him. He tumbled, but slowly, like a feather, like a wraith of fog. He alighted on the rocks with hardly a jar, cushioned by some advanced application of a force-field. A large cube of metal was there to convey them to the top once more. After that, he became giddy. He did not know why, but the impulse to laugh Was too strong to resist. He laughed until it grew painful, laughed until the tears came to his eyes. \"That is joy,\" said the voice. \"I can instill joy in you. But the way you express it, that is unique. More!\" And Steve\\'s laughter bubbled up insanely again. The creature was wrong -- not joy. Hysteria, more nearly. Unused to emotions, the creature could not tell them apart. Something grabbed his arms and held itA giant vise which could crush and twist. Me saw nothing, realized that it was some mental trick--but thoroughly effective. His arm was being wrenched from its socket, slowly, terribly. He clenched his teeth, groaned. From somewhere far off, tne voice laughed calmly. \"I like that. Oh yes, I do. I like your reaction to pain,\" An intense loathing he had never before experienced took hold of him. At first he thought it was another trick, but he could sense alarm in the creature which shared him. The loathing, then, was his body\\'s reaction to its parasite. Almost, he could feel the creature squirming, and he gave free reign to the emotion. \"Stop!\" The voice was strident, alarmed. I hate you, Steve thought intensely. I hate you, \"Stop! I warn you, you will kill us with that, or drive us insane.\" Vertigo followed the loathing as the creature fought back. Steve was tired, suddenly more tired than he\\'d ever been. He sank back into blackness, knew even as his senses fled that his mind alone would sleep, not his body. With two minds, the body would not sleep at all -- and in a matter of months it would perish of fatigue. But the creature within him feared his hatred, and that he must remember. T he days followed each other in a slow, tortuous procession. Nothing seemed to satiate the parasite, for each day it strove for new emotions, and after a time Steve learned he could frustrate it by regarding everything as unreal, imaginative, non-existent. Sometimes, the guest slept when the host did not. At such times, Steve found, he had freedom of a sort. His field of action was not circumscribed in any way except that violent activity would awaken the parasite. Steve toyed with his freedom, timorously at first, then grew more confident. He played with it, basked in it after steady days of control. He even discovered he could use the telepathic abilities of his uninvited mental guest. He missed Teejay, wondered about her, longed for her. His astonishment was so extreme when he first heard her voice within hisead that he almost awakened the parasite. \"Steve? Steve, is that you?\" \"Teejay -- \" \"I\\'ve been trying to reach you. When these creatures sleep, we can use their minds.\" \"Then you\\'re all right?\" \"I\\'m as all right as can be expected, Steve, But they\\'ve been running me through all sorts of emotional mazes. My clothing is torn and they don\\'t care about it. My skin is torn and bruised. They don\\'t care about that, either. They\\'ll run us down. Did you notice all the other creatures here? Some of their bones are broken -- if they have bones -- and they\\'ve never been set. They\\'re bruised and bloody and infected and the parasites don\\'t care! Why should they, they can get new bodies? But Steve -- oh, Steve, I\\'ve never felt so unclean in all my life and it\\'s just as if I\\'ve been defiled and -- \" \"Take it easy, Teejay. Thinking like that won\\'t help.\" \"I hate them. Oh, I hate them. I -- \" \"Listen. I want you to concentrate like that. Hate weakens them. Remember how the animals aboard the Frank BucA: died? Well, since our emotions are so much stronger than the parasites, maybe, maybe -- \"  \"You mean it could work in reverse \"I don\\'t know.\" \"You want me to try, darling?\" \"Yes -- no! We can\\'t do it now. If it works, we\\'d still be leaving a hundred men here. They\\'re doomed. Tee jay. We\\'re all doomed unless we can do something about it, and soon. But at night they sleep. Yeah, they sleep at night! If we can contact the others, and make a concentrated effort of it, using the telepathic powers of the parasites -- \" \\'\\'Shh! That\\'s enough, Steve. My friend here is getting up. I can feel him stirring inside my head. Shh, later!\" At the end, hope had made Teejay her old spunky self again. But when Steve\\'s own master awakened,that hope seemed mightly slim indeed. Each night they managed to contact two or three of the others, and the word was supposed to be passed on. Finally, it was arranged. The night for action was decided upouj and for some few of them it would be a gamble, for there was no guarantee that all the parasites would be asleep. Once the attempt was made, however, there would be no turning back. Whoever was left behind -- was left behind. Provided the plan worked at all. T he creature was asleep again. \\'T hate ycAi,\" Steve said quietly. Silence. hate youf He thought it now, thought it with all his being -- and somehow he could sense the thought was being reinforced as scores of men concentrated on it around the city. The mind within him stirred sluggishly, but he ushed it under again. Hate, hate, ate. Hadn\\'t the creature said it could kill them both? A gamble. Everything was a gamble. Naturally the parasite would say that, Steve began to sweat, physically. He was weak and the muscles of his arms and legs trembled. His mind found the strange telepathic channel of the parasite, traveled inward along it -- with hatred. That, at least, was easy. He did hate the creature so thoroughly and so completely that the feeling pushed everything else from his mind. A concert of hatred, all over the city. And slumbering masters who might or, might not awaken. \"Stop!\" A clarion command inside his skull. The parasite was fighting back. Steve tumbled to the floor, lay there writhing. Two minds fought for control of his body, and he was being pushed back and out of control. He got to his feet stiffly, strode to a cabinet, took out a knife. He stared at the knife,  fascinated, pointed it toward his chest. \"One of us must die, human, but it shall not be I!\" He drove the knife inward, slowly, an inch at a time toward his chest. He felt the point sting, saw a thin trickle of blood. For a moment, he fought to possess his arms and the knife with them. That was a mistake -- almost, a fatal one. The parasite wanted that, for, in such a battle, it would win everytime. Perhaps it could not fight his hatred, but it could fight anything else he had to offer. The knife went in, scraped against a rib. Steve yelled hoarsely, drenched every atom of his soul in hatred. Slowly, he withdrew the knife, watched bright red blood well up aifter it. Something tugged at his mind, slipped away -- first scalding, then wet. It oozed out, and pain blurred Steve\\'s vision as he tumbled to the floor again. When he got up moments later and managed to staunch the flow of blood, he knew the parasite had perished. near the city gate -- grim and weary, most of them with fresh wounds. Steve\\'s joy was an emotion the dead parasite would have loved to share when he saw Teej ay among the sixty. Kevin was there too, and Steiner. Surprisingly, Schuyler Barling seemed more sprightly than the rest. \"LeClarc?\" Steve demanded. \"He was the first,\" said Kevin. \"Stronger control, perhaps. He\\'s among those who could not make it.\" \"Maybe they\\'re still alive.\" \"No,\" Teejay told him. \"I saw three men die, horribly. Most of the others probably did, too.\" \"Don\\'t you see, boy, we can\\'t chance survival for all of us to seek out one or two who might still be alive! It wouldn\\'t be fair.\" Kevin shook his head grimly. Steve knew he was right. He was far too exhausted to argue, anyway. \"Then we\\'ll go as we are?\" \"Well, there are half a dozen others in the gate-house now, forcing information from some of the hosts.\" \"What information?\" \"About sub-space, boy. A hunter named McSweeney was possessed by a scientist of sorts, and he learned the sub-space gear is a compact little device which a man can carry. They store a few dozen of \\'em in the gate-house, and -- hello!\" Half a dozen men emerged from the stone structure, and one of them fell as a beam of energy seared out and caught him. A variety of creatures streamed out after them, triggering strange weapons. Soon the fighting became general, and it looked for a time as though the humans -- without weapons of any sort -- would be slaughtered. But Steve grabbed one of the stilt-creatures, twisted its neck quickly, heard a sharp cracking sound. The creature fell and Steve plunged down with it, coming up with the handweapon and firing into the ranks that bore down upon them. As others of the aliens fell, men retrieved their weapons, fighting back with eyer-increased firepower, although their numbers were decreasing. And battling thus, they broke through the gate and out among the purple-misted hills. Hissing beams of energy emitted sufficient light to see by, and Kevin\\'s voice could be heard roaring above the sounds of fighting: \"Stick together! If a man\\'s lost in this purple fdg, he\\'s done for! Stick together!\" It was a nightmare. Steve fought shoulder to shoulder with Teejay. Now that he\\'d been reunited with her, there\\'d be no more separation, he vowed silently. Not unless he died here on the purple world. Energy beams crossed back and forth as the men retreated, stumbling and darting among the little hillocks. Time lost its normally rigid control. Hours might have been minutes, or the other way around. Time became utterly subjective, with each man living in his own particular continuum. For Steve it seemed at least a short version of eternity until they reached the Frank Buck, And when they did, dawn was streaking the horizon with pale blue radiance, casting a deep purple shadow from the ship to where they fought. It was Kevin who reached the airlock first, Kevin who sprung it open. Two by two they filed in, still facing the aliens and firing their weapons. At the last moment -- when fully half of those who remained had entered the ship -- the three anthrovacs appeared, came loping across the plain toward them. Steve cut the first one down and drew careful aim on the second. It wasn\\'t necessary. The third anthrovac abruptly turned on its fellow and sent it reeling, senseless, with one blow. In the confusion, its parasite must have been careless, must have relaxed its control. The anthrovac, which made a habit of miming men, whirled and began to wreck havoc among the pursuers. It helped turn the tide of battle, and with Steve and Teejay, it was the last to enter the ship.L Kevin said grimly. \"There are twentytwo who survived.\" They all sat about, nursing their wounds. The ship had flung itself through hyper-space, now hovered \"You\\'re wrong. There are twentythree.\" It was Charlie Stedman. In the darkness and confusion, he\\'d managed to fight his way back with them. But why? \"Charlie!\" Steve forgot the question. \"You\\'re free too.\" Charlie lifted a neutron gun. \"No. You\\'re wrong. None of us is free. You\\'ll find a ship has followed you Jiere. And you\\'re going to follow it back.\" Of course, Steve thought dully. Charlie was dead. Charlie could hot return as himself. But they were right back where they started from, for the creature who was Charlie could force their return. Kevin stood near the viewport, spoke grimly. \"He\\'s not lying. There\\'s a ship out there.\" Schuyler Barling smiled coldly, took up his position near Charlie. \"You all rejected my command once,\" he said. \"You shouldn\\'t have. I had no desire to come back to Earth like that. I\\'ve also learned that I can share my body on an equal basis with my master, something none of you would consider. Now we\\'ll take you back.\" Almost eighty men had died -- for nothing. Steve held Teejay\\'s hand briefly, released it. One life more wouldn\\'t matter, and if there were a chance... \"Charlie, don\\'t you remember anything?\" \"What should I remember?\" \"I\\'m your brother.\" \"That much I knew vyhen I called you on Ganymede. But there are no emotional ties. Keep back!\" Steve took a step toward him. \"You\\'re my brother, and you wouldn\\'t kill me. You can\\'t.\" It was wild, impossible, and he knew it. The creature was not his brother, had not been his brother for years. Yet if some small vestige of his brother\\'s emotional memories remained -- \"Keep back, I warn you!\" Steve could see the finger tightening on the trigger when he dove. His shoulder jarred Charlie\\'s knees, and they went dwn together, rolling over and over on the floor... The neutron gun hissed once, between them, and Charlie relaxed. A smile tugged at the comers of his mouth for a moment, and he said, \"Steve.\" He died that way, with the smile still on his lips.  Schuyler Barling was, laughing and screaming, froth flecking his chin. The delicate balance between parasite and host had been entangled, possibly beyond repair. Neither could dominate, and the result was a hopeless, gibbering hulk of a man. \"Poor devil,\" said Kevin. \"He\\'ll get psychiatric treatment on Earth, if that will help.\" Steve crossed to the airlock, climbed into a spacesuit. \"What the hell do you think you\\'re doing?\" Teejay wanted to know. \"You\\'re forgetting about the bther ship. We haven\\'t got a blasting cannon on the Frank Buck, and there isn\\'t one down on the Gordak, either. But with no absorbing medium in space, one of these neutron guns can be a potent weapon.\" Steve clamped the fishbowl helmet down over his head and activated the airlock. Soon he stood outside, with nothing but space on three sides of him. On the fourth, his magnetic boots gripped the Frank Bucks steeloid hull as he set himself, ready to fire the small hand gun. Energy flared brightly from its muzzle, and the other ship, a slim, sinister shape miles off in the void, flared up with it and dissolved in a shower of sparks and mist. But the neutron gun had a kick which dislodged Steve from the hull and sent him spinning off into space. Through the lockport, no more than four feet away, he saw Kevin donning a vac-suit. The big Exec reached out to grab him but his arm fell a full foot short. All at once, Kevin was dwarfed by the anthrovac as the big animal joined him, scratching its head as Kevin reached out hopelessly iilto space. The gap was increasing. Did the anthrovac understand? No, Steve thought; an anthrovac could ,no more understand than a parrot could actually talk. But like a parrot, an anthrovac could mimic. A huge hairy arm reached out into space, the hand locking on Steve\\'s gauntleted fist. He was drawn back into the Frank Buck and to safety, and it was many minutes before they could stop the anthrovac from probing out experimentally into empty space. Teejay and Kevin later, \"I think at the last minute my brother understood.\" \"It looked that way to me, boy,\" Kevin nodded. \"So he died happy. But there\\'s a lot of work for Earth to do. We\\'ll have to clear the System of anything that remains here of Uashalume\\'s power. And then maybe someday we\\'ll have to get up an expedition and clean out that foul place.\" \"One good thing came from it,\" Steve told them. \"We\\'ve got subspace drive now, and the stars are ours.\" He lit a cigarette, frowning. \"But I think we ought to go easy on our game-hunting, and you can tell that to Brody Carmical or anyone else, Tee jay. Those, creatures out there were hunters too, you know.\" \"Forget about the past, will you?\" Teejay snapped at him, then A chat with the editor... Continued from page # pleasant little town called Patterson -- New York, not New Jersey -- so I spend quite a little time on the road between points. About a week after our first issue hit the stands, I drove up to Kingston wistfully hoping there\\' d be a couple of dozen letters from fans and friends wishing us success. Well, a dozen, maybe, or at least a few postcards. I got into the office and asked Miss Bogert, our gal MondayFriday, \"What\\'s with the IF correspondence?\" \"Over there,\" she said, pointing. I looked but all I could see was an old dirty canvas sack. grinned when he looked hurt. \"I still feel unclean, Steve. I\\'d love to sit in a hot bath for about twentyfour hours straight.\" Steve grinned back. \"If we were married, I could scrub around your shoulder-blades for you.\" Kevin cleared his throat ominously. \"They made me Captain of this ship, didn\\'t they. What are we waiting for?\" The ceremony was brief, and after it, Steve and Teejay hustled back to the recreation rooms and swimming pools with a bar of strong soap, a couple of washcloths, and a lot of pleasant ideas. \"Come again.\" \"In the bag.\" \"In the hagr It rocked me back on my heels. Mail for IF, loaded into a big canvas sack and brought over\\' personally by Uncle Sam. I had never befoie in my life gotten mail the same way Sears Roebuck gets it. The thrill was memorable. The total figure for the first nine days on the newsstands was six hundred and twentyfour letters and cards. This, according to our very able distributors, is much better than completely satisfactory and slightly less than phenomenal. I was plenty embarrassed because I\\'d reserved only two pages for our letter column. From now on, much more space will be allocated. Continued on page # Only one question seemed important in this huge space venture: Who was flying where? Welcome, Martians! By S. A. Lombino T he only sound was the swish of the jets against the sand as the big ship came down. Slowly, nose pointed skyward, a yellow tail streaming out behind the tubes, it settled to the ground like a cat nuzzling its haunches against a velvet pillow. Dave Langley peered through the viewport. \"I feel kind of funny,\" he said. A tremor of excitement flooded through Gal Manners\\' thin frame. \"Mars,\" he whispered. \"We made it.\" Gently, the fins probed the sand, poking into it. Cal cut the power and the big ship shuddered and relaxed, a huge metal spider with a conical head. Gal peered through the viewport, his eyes scanning the planet. Behind him, Dave shrugged into a space suit, gathered up his instruments. \"I\\'ll make the tests,\" Dave said. \"Keep the starboard guns trained on me.\" Cal nodded. He walked Dave to the airlock and lifted the toggles on the inner hatch. Dave stepped into the small chamber, and Cal snapped the hatch shut. He walked quickly to the starboard guns, wiggled into the plastic seat behind them and pitched his shoulders against the braces. Outside, like a grotesque balloon, Dave stumbled around on weighted feet, taking his readings. Whafs out there? Cal wondered. Just exactly what? He tightened his grip on the big blasters, and trained the guns around to where Dave puttered in the sand. Dave suddenly stood\\' erect, waved at Cal, and started lumbering back toward the ship. Gal left the guns and went to the airlock. He stepped into the chamber closed the toggles on the hatch behind him, and twirled the wheel on the outer hatch. He was ready to move back into the ship again when Dave stepped through the outer hatch, his helpiet under his arm. \"It\\'s okay, Gal. Breathable atmosphere. And the pressure is all right, too.\" Gal let out a sigh of relief. \"Gome on.\" he said. \"Get out of that monkey suit. Then we\\'ll claim the planet for Earth.\" They went back into the ship, and Dave took off the suit, hanging it carefully in its locker. Both men strapped on holsters and drew stun guns from the munitions locker. They checked the charges in their weapons, bolstered them, and stepped out into the Martian night. It was cold, but their clothing was warm and the air was invigorating. Gal looked up at the sky. \"Phobos,\" he said, pointing. \"And Deimos,\" Dave added. \"Ike and Mike.\" \"Yeah.\" Dave smiled. \"How do you feel, Dave?\" Gal asked suddenly. \"How do you mean?\" \"Mars. I mean, we\\'re the first men to land on Mars. The first, Dave!\" They were walking aimlessly. In no particular hurry. \"It\\'s funny,\" Dave said. \"I told you before. I feel kind of -- \" almost exploded into being, tore through the silence of the planet like the strident scream of a wounded animal. Trumpets blasted raucously, trombones moaned and slid, bass drums pounded a steady tattoo. Tubas, heavy and solemn like old men belching. Glarinets, shrill and squealing. Gymbals clashing. A military band blaring its march into the night. \"Wha -- \" Dave\\'s mouth hung open. He stared into the distance. There were lights, and the brass gleamed dully. A group of men were marching toward them, blowbanners in the air. \"People,\" Gal said. \"And music. Like ours. Music just like ours\\' The procession spilled across the sand like an unravelling spool of brightly colored silk. Ghildren danced on the outskirts of the group, hopping up and down, screaming in glee. Women waved banners, sang along with the band. And the music shouted out across the sand, a triumphal march with a lively beat. A fat man led the procession. He was beaming, his smile a great enamelled gash across his face. The music became louder, closer, earshattering now. \"Welcome,\" the shouts rang out. \"Welcome.\" \"Welcome!\" \"English!\" The word escaped Dave\\'s lips, in a sudden hiss. \"For God\\'s sake, Cal, they\\'re speaking English.\" \"Something\\'s wrong,\" Cal said tightly. \"This isn\\'t Mars. We\\'ve made a ihi stake, Dave.\" The fat man was closer now, still grinning, his stomach protruding, a gold watch hanging across his vest beneath his jacket. He wore a white carnation in his buttonhole. A homburg, blacky was perched solidly atop his head. \"They\\'re human\\' Dave whispered. The fat man stopped before them, raised his hands. The music ceased as abruptly as it had begun. He stepped forward and extended his hand. \"Welcome home,\" he said. Welcome home! The words seared acrpss Cal\\'s mind with sudden understanding. \"There\\'s some mistake . , he started. \"Mistake?\" The fat man chuckled. \"Nonsense, nonsense. I am Mayor Panley. You\\'re back in New Galleth, gentlemen. The city is yours. The world is yours ! Welcome home.\" \"You don\\'t understand,\" Cal persisted, \"We\\'ve just come from Earth, We\\'ve just travelled more than # miles through space. We\\'re from Earth.\" \"I know,\" the mayor said, \"I know.\" \"You know?\" \"But of course. Isn\\'t it wonderful?\" The crowd cheered behind him, telling the night how wonderful it was. Cal blinked, turned to Dave. The mayor put his arms about the two men. \"We\\'ve been watching your approach for weeks. I\\'ll have to admit we were a little worried in the beginning.\" \"Worried?\" The mayor began chuckling again. \"Why yes, yes. Not that we didn\\'t think you\\'d makp it. But there were some who... ahh, here are the television trucks now.\" The trucks wheeled across the sand, just like the thousands of trucks Cal had seen back on Earth, The television cameras pointed down at them, and the men stood behind them with earphones on. \"Smile. Smile,\" the mayor whispered. Cal smiled. Dave, smiled, too. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Mayor Panley said to the cameras, \"It is the distinct hpnor of New Calleth... The crowd raised their voices, drowning out his voice. The banners waved, yellow, red, blue, orange. Welcome, welcome, welcome. \"... the distinct honor of New Calleth to be able to welcome home Bobby Galus and Gary Dale.\" \"Galus! Dale!\" the voices sang, \"Galus! Dale!\" \"Galus!\" \"Dale!\" \"Just a second,\" Cal interrupted. \"You don\\'t understand at all. Those aren\\'t our... \"Four years in space,\" the mayor continued, \"four years among the stars. To Earth and back, fellow citizens, for the glory of Mars.\" \"You\\'ve got that twisted,\" Cal said. \"We didn\\'t...\" The mayor took Cal\\'s elbow and turned him toward the cameras. \"You were in space for four years, weren\\'t you Captain Galus?\" \"Yes, we were. But it wasn\\'t... \"Space!\" the mayor gushed. \"Limitless space. The first men to land on Earth.\" Again the cries of the crowd split the night. \"Across the stretches of sky,\" the mayor continued. \"Across the unchartered wilderness above, across the... T here were banquets and more banquets, and women of every size and shape. The city of New Calieth went all out to welcome the space travellers. Bobby Galus and Gary Dale. At the end of a week of festivity, the mayor came to Cal and Dave. \"Have you enjoyed your stay, boys?\" he asked, \"It was swell,\" Cal said, \"but youVe got things all... \"I was wondering when you planned on leaving for the capitol. Don\\'t misunderstand me. We\\'d like you to stay as long as you want to, but...\" \"For God\\'s sake,\" Cal snapped,  \"will you please listen to me?\" Mayor Panley was visibly shaken. \"Why, of course, Captain Galus. Of course. Why, certainly.\" He lapsed into silence. \"I\\'m not Bobby Galus,\" Cal said. \"And this isn\\'t Gary Dale.\" The mayor nodded his head. \"You\\'re... not... Galus and Dale,\" he said slowly. \"That\\'s right,\" Cal said. \"We didn\\'t go to Earth. We came from there. This is the first time we\\'ve ever been on. Mars. Do you understand? We\\'re Earthmen.\" \"Earthmen?\" The mayor considered this for a second and then burst out laughing. \"Why, that\\'s preposterous. Absolutely preposterous!\" His laugh rose in volume to a bellow. \"Oh, you\\'re joking. I should have known. You\\'re only joking.\" \"We\\'re not joking. This is all some kind of a horrible mistake. We\\'re the first men to land on Mars. You\\'ve got to understand that,\" Dave pleaded. The mayor was still laughing. He walked to the door and opened it. \"All right, boys, have your little joke. You\\'ve earned the right to it. I\\'ll make arrangements for you to leave for Dome City in the morning.\" He shook his head and chuckled again. \"Earthmen. Tchtch.\" And then he was gone. They sat alone in the hotel room. It looked like any Earth hotel they\\'d ever been in. A big soft bed. A wall telephone. Twn dressers. Two armchairs. A big mirror over one of the dressers. A television set on the other dresser. \"This is screwy,\" Dave said. \"Is it possible we\\'re back on Earth? Is it possible the joke is on us? Maybe everyone is just ribbing us. Maybe we\\'ve been going around in circles for four years. Maybe... \"No,\" Cal said. \"We\\'re on Mars all right. I don\\'t know exactly how to explain it, but I\\'ve got an idea.\" \"What\\'s that?\" Dave asked. Gal shrugged. \"Probably all wrong, of course. But it has something to do with comparable development of cultures on different planets.\" \"You mean Mars is in exactly the same state of development as Earth?\" \"Something like that. You know the theory. Give two different places the same materials to start with, and their cultures will run parallel to each other for the rest of their existence.\" \"Sure,\" Dave said. \"But these guys Galus and Dale. How the hell could we possibly be mistaken for them?\" \\'T don\\'t know.\" Cal leaned back on the bed and stared at the ceiling. \"Maybe we\\'ll find out in Dome City.\" \"Maybe\\' Dave repeated hollowly. greeted their ship in Dome City. There were more parades, banners, bands, banquets, reporters, cameras, confetti, women, speeches, presentations. And at feist, they stood before the President\\'s desk, two bodyguards standing on either side of him. He was a thin man, slightly balding, with rimless glasses, \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I don\\'t have to tell you how pleased I am.\" Gal took a deep breath. \"We\\'ve been trying to tell Mayor Panley,\" he said, \"that we are not Galus and Dale.\" The President smiled. \"I know. He told me of your little joke.\" \"It\\'s not a joke.\" The President cocked an eyebrow. \"No?\" He looked at his bodyguards. \"Has space affec... did you feel any ill effects in space?\", he asked. Gal grimaced. \"Oh great! Now he thinks we\\'re psycho. Look, can\\'t you get this through your heads? IVe are from Earth, We never heard of Galus and Dale. My name is Calvin Manners, and this is David Langley.\" \"Very interesting,\" the President said. He tapped his finger on the back of his other hand and stared at the two Earthmen. He reached over toward the inteicom on his desk then and pressed a button. \"Yes?\" a woman\\'s voice asked. \"Miss Daniels, will you bring in the photos of Gapt. Galus and Lt. Dale, please?\" \"Yes, sir.\" The President turned to the two men again. \"Those are your ranks, are they not?\" \"Yes, but we\\'re in the United  States Army.\" \"The whatr \"The United States Army. The United States is a country on Earth.\" \"Really? Now we\\'re getting somewhere. What else does Earth have? What is it like? Are the inhabitants intelligent?\" \"Yes, we are. We\\'re Earthmen, can\\'t you understand that?\" \"I think you\\'re carrying this joke a little too far, gentlemen. A joke of dollars on your trip. Really, this \"is no time for banter.\" Gal opened his mouth, ready to protest, just as the outside door swung wide. An attractive blonde in a smart suit stepped into the room and walked to the President\\'s desk. She kept her eyes glued to the two Earthmen, dropped two large photographs on the desk, and turned. She stared over her shoulder at Cal and Dave until she was gone. The President smiled knowingly. \"The women are failing all over you two, I imagine.\" \"We\\'re both married,\" Cal said drily. \"We don\\'t care for all this... \"Married?\" The President was shocked. \"I thought we\\'d distinctly chosen unmarried men for the job. Strange.\\' \"WeVe got wives on Earth Dave said. \"Ah-ha,\" the President said. \"Then they are intelligent beings. Pity, pity.\"  A twinge of anticipation curled up Gal\\'s spine. \"Pity? Why a pity? Why do you say that?\" \"Well, you know. Surely you realized this was the only flight we could afford.\" \"What?\" \"For the meantime, anyway. We may attempt another flight in fifty years, sixty perhaps maybe more. But you\\'ve already proved space travel, Capt. Galus. The achievement is ours. All we need now is money to...\" \"Damn it. I\\'m not Capt. Galus,\\'\" Cal shouted. \"And we\\'ve got to get back to Earth. I\\'ve got a kid, Mr. President. He\\'s six years old and... Cal stopped abruptly. \"Oh, this is all nonsenseWhy am I arguing with you? Can\\'t you understand that we are Earthmen? What do we have to do to prove it?\" The President sighed and turned over the photographs on the desk. They were glossy prints of two men in uniform. They were young men, in khaki, smiles on their faces. One man looked exactly like Calvin Manners. The other strongly resembled David Langley. \"Here are your photographs,\" the President said. \"This is you, captain, and you, lieutenant. They were taken before the trip. You\\'re younger, of course.\" Gal stared at the photograph. It could have been he. The nose was a little sharper, perhaps, and the face thinner. But it could have been he. # could have been he! \"It\\'s a freak accident,\" he shouted. \"A coincidence in two parallel cultures, a...\" He saw the look on the President\\'s face then. It was a cold look, and a suspicious one. Cal stopped speaking, sweat staining the armpits of his uniform shirt. The President grinned again. \"That\\'s better. I understand the strain of space, gentlemen, but we must be practical, mustn\\'t we?\" He paused. \"Shall we talk about Earth now?\" T he only sound was the swish of the jets against the grass as the big ship came down. Slowly, nose pointed skyward, a yellow tail streaming out behind the tubes, it settled to the ground like a cat nuzzling its haunches against a velvet pillow... In the distance, the lights of New York danced crazily, gleaming from a thousand spires that scratched the sky. The radios blared forth excitedly, and the police  cars screamed through the night as they rushed to City Hall to pick up the mayor. Inside the ship, Gary Dale peered through the viewport. \"I feel kind of funny,\" he said. A tremor of excitement flooded through Bobby Galus\\' thin frame. \"Earth,\" he whispered, \"We made it.\" Personalities While his circulation climbed, the stf world wondered E arly in #, a letter addressed to the Discussions column of Amazing Stories was opened by Howard Browne, then managing editor of the Z-D pulp chain. The letter was signed by a resident of Pennsylvania named Richard S. Shaver. Browne read the letter, snorted with characteristic honesty, and tossed it into the wastebasket, Browne\\'s exact remark relative to the letter is not recorded. Possibly it contained the word \"crackpot\". The gist of it was certainly: \"That\\'s the last anyone will ever see of But Browne was wrong. He reckoned without the subsequent activities of a much-debated genius named Raymond A. Palmer, then editor of Amazing, known throughout the stf field as rap, those being the initials Vith which he signed editorials. Palmer retrieved the letter, visualized its possibilities -- possibilities which would have entirely escaped nine editors out of ten -- and the so-called Shaver Mystery was born. The Shaver Mystery did many things. It attracted a great many people; it angered a great many other people; it became the most widely discussed of all science fiction facets, bringing howls of denunciation from not only the organized fan clubs, but also from some of the most widely circulated and highly respected magazines in the nation, several of which lashed out bitterly at this \"highly danger. ous nonsense\". And -- not to be overlooked -- the Shaver Mystery added aft extra # copies per month to the circulation of Amazing Stories, the bellwether of the Ziff-Davis pulp chain. A good many students of the unusual made exhaustive investigations into the phenomenon salvaged so astutely from Browne\\'s wastebasket. But the vast majority of them erred in basic procedure. They sought answers to such questions as: What is the Shaver Mystery? Who is Richard S. Shaver? Their prime question should have been: Who is Raymond A. Palmer? Shaver himself is of minor interest in the investigation of the science fiction bombshell which bears his name. He was -- and still is -- a highly competent writer concerning whom, Palmer states : Shaver encouraged by the publication of the letter y sent the rest of his secret -- the story of the Titans, Atlantis, and the caves of today. # words of A .Warning To Future Man\", to he printed as a letter without pay. He had no thought of being an author\". So I rewrote, making it #, largely Palmer. I still have the original manuscript if anyone would like proof it was not submitted as a story. It wasnt. Only the secret. And with that. Shaver would have rested. But I wanted to show... writers aren\\'t geniuses, or even special people, or even \\'educated\". Just so they know # words and have an imagination. Shaver had both. No one could disagree with this last except to suggest that rap far understates the extent of Shaver\\'s vocabulary. Shaver wrote -- under his own name and many pen names -- the original drafts of all the stories hinging upon the mystery. But above and behind him loomed the figure of Raymond A. Palmer, eliminating almost completely, Shaver\\'s importance as a subject for investigation relative to the works in question. highlighted by appalling misfortune, great adversity and high courage. He was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on August #st, #. At the age of seven he was run over by a truck and permanent-? ly crippled. This last is worthy of note because there is reason to believe it engendered within him a bitterness he never outgrew. It also may be responsible for at least a portion of has many friends, but to arrive at the point of really knowing him is a long and difficult process at which few have succeeded. His most discernible characteristic is beyond doubt a never-yielding determination. He is a prolific writer, and he speaks of his early struggles in that field: If I knew an editor was in the market for a story, he\\'d have to buy it from me. If he wanted a sixtythousand word novel. I\\'d have it there when the doors opened. If he wanted a five, or a ten, or a fifteenthousand worder. I\\'d be there with it before anybody else. As a result of this energy and the ability to produce, he sold an astounding amount of fiction. Three percentage of which he produced while functioning for eight years as a sheet metal worker; ten years as a bookkeeper ; four years as an estimator in the building trades. Palmer\\'s noteworthy career really began when he was offered the editorship of Amazing Stories in #. Ziff from The Teck Publishing Company, and Palmer took over the editorial chair in Chicago. From some strange whim rather than of necessity, Palmer followed the Spartan pattern the first few months of his editorship, spending each day exactly #c for food. This amount was divided into a nickel for breakfast, eleven cents for lunch, and a nightly banquet upon which he squandered twenty-one cents. Later, as the circulation of his magazine climbed, Palmer allocated somewhat more of his funds to the inner man. After #, things got steadily better in the fiction field. Under Palmer\\'s guidance, the Ziff-Davis string expanded. Western, detective,-and adventure books were added. These Palmer turned over to new editors, keeping for himself Amazing Stones and a partial hand on the helm of Fantastic Ad ventures, its companion book. So, when Shaver\\'s letter figuratively jumped into Palmer\\'s hands, he was ready for it. And he knew, that readers of science fiction were ready for it. After the first reader-reaction, Palmer went to Pennsylvania for a personal visit with Shaver, gave him the green light, and went back to Chicago to check circulation figures. They were indeed gratifying. Letters began pouring in, abusing Shavfer and praising him. information he claims to have received -- voices which spoke to him, first through a turret lathe upon which he worked in a war plant. Many correspondents claimed company with Shaver in hearing the voices. Other correspondents took the view that Shaver was plain nuts -- that his copy was dangerous and should be removed from the newsstands. The fan clubs cluttered the mails with wrathy epistles, boycotting Palrper\\'s \"mystery\" and consigning it to damnation. Then the club members dashed to the stands for the next issue of Amazing to see if their letters had been published. Palmer smiled, published them, and published more Shaver. Circulation zoomed. about is hard to determine. An understanding revulsion was felt in some Quarters to the heavy sex-andsadism flavor of the copy. It had a distinct Kraft-Ebbing touch and could hardly be rated as cheerful reading. There appeared to be no great secret nor any unsolvable mystery. The so-called mystery appeared to be the premise-frame upon which Shaver hung reams of erotic copy. The voices to which Shaver\\'s remarkable ear was attuned, told him of a race of superior beings who purportedly inhabited the earth untold ages ago. This race functioned with benefit of mechanical gadgetry far in advance of our present equipment of that type. This advanced race. Shaver tells us, held sway over an inferior race of beings who bore them no good will whatever and would have done them in had the opportunity presented itself. They were held in check however, Eventually, the superior race, entirely familiar with space-travel, set out for greener planets. The inferior race, termed \"deros\", was left behind with all the advanced equipment known in the storyseries as \"mech\". And, Shaver vows, the deros are still with us; living in caves under the earth, and doing their very best to make things miserable for those who live topside. There are no tricks to which the deros will not stoop. They cause men to fail in both business and social life. They arrange nervous breakdowns. They jammed up Editor Palmer\\'s typewriter and stole pertinent copy off his desk. They man the flying saucers that have bewildered our population for some time... ShavePs source of information was bottomless; he put it into stories; Palmer printed the stories. Circulation continued its\\' happy ascent. Such a bomb as this one, however, was slated by the very nature of things for a final explosion of some sort. The explosion came abruptly -- when the public clamor for an execution reached the ears of pany. They publish a number of magazines other than those in their pulp chain. Also, at the time in qiiestion, they were publishing both hard-cover books and a series of smaller volumes retailing below a dollar. Mr. Ziff is a civic-minded individual who gave and still gives a great deal of his time to projects outside his firm. For these reasons, he probably gave little attention to the pulp group, knowing it to be in competent hands. So it is entirely probable that when he first heard mention of the Shaver Mystery, he knew far less about it than the average reader of science fiction ; stf being a field of letters in which Mr. Ziff had little time to pleasure himself. But he made a point of looking in on the works of Mr. Shaver and had but one comment : \"Kill it.\" Palmer has an added explanation: I had decided to go into the publishing business on my own. Naturally I would have to quit when I brought out a book in competition with Z-D. So I thought ahead -- two years -- and asked myself if Howard Browne , could handle this hot potato...  couldnt saddle my successor with a bomb like that. So I tapered the Mystery o, then killed it myself. I worked it so Ziff would disapprove. Another example of Palmer\\'s ability is the Jesse James affair. This was probably his greatest promotional attempt. Its failure was due to circumstances beyond his control. He states: I had befriended the wife of a former Chief of Detectives (#I ) of St. Louis and who knew Frank James and all the other \\'boys personally In both cases the quotes are Palmer\\'s. She came to me with a revelation that a Dalton, out west, had told her he ivas  J and would she act as a confidante for his story or confession. She brought photos. I compared ears, decided Dalton really was James. I paid her way and that of her husband, to Oklahoma to find out. Her husband identified the man positively... I went to the nearest radio commentator -- the story was off... Today half of America believes it really was Jesse and the other half laughs  Me? I know it was Jesse, T have the proof ,... Jesses dead now. Just a few\\' weeks ago. For the last time. There\\'ll never be another claimant. I made sure af that... said in his statement. A great deal which indicates the laughing half of America has by far the best case. One interesting sidelight on the affair was that the couple who brought Palmer the great news also oflfered proof that Billy the Kid the Missouri raider, were alive and well. If the evidence of these people is to be taken, it must be assumed that no one really dies. Mathematically, the chance of Dalton being James, are exactly twenty to one; that including James himself and the nineteen pretenders who have come forward through the years. And Palmer is probably right in the assertion that the last James has been buried. There are very few men aged one hundred and ten with the strength to come forward. Two points, still unmentioned relative to the James affair, are important in that they indicate Palmer has never deviated an inch from his basic and admirable talent -- that of selling magazines. When the Dalton-James proposition came to light, Palmer secured a contract and began immediately planning a Jesse James Western Magazine. At the same time he set his eye on the Chicago Railroad Fair and thought what a publicity scoop it would be if the roads would recognize and honor Dalton-James by allotting him a day in their program. This, Palmer believed -- and rightly so -- would be the clincher. But Major Lennox Lohr, in charge of the affair, didn\\'t care whether Dalton was James or not. He took a dim view of honoring a man whose name was synonymous with lawlessness. Immediately upon the heels of this decision. Palmer\\'s interest in Dalton became strictly academic. So the Shaver Mystery and the affair Dalton-James, have two points in common. Neither can stand up under even preliminary examination. And both are amazingly good copy. Labeling both of them hoaxes may be construed as criticism of Palmer. It is not meant to be. This is a day of supersalesmanship. Hoaxes far more dangerous and sinister are arranged in advertising agencies every day. Claims made in blatant print relative to deodorants, cigarettes, trusses, and dozens of other products are far more preposterous than the assertion that a lot of little men called deros are giving us a bad time. This last becomes almost probable when lined up beside a statement that a bar of soap will make a woman beautiful in two weeks. So, in these times of drab and unconvincing falsehood, there is still something to be thankful for. A Palmer promotion has the touch of genius. It has zing, sparkle, and true showmanship. It can be spotted a mile away by the bright lights. The thing to do is sit back and enjoy it. -- pwf Are you ready for me, Asir? Strange gods were worshipped on Mars. But were they so clever? T hey\\'d lost their own world. It Takes a Thief By Waiter Miller, Jr. T he ancient gods, our Fathersy rode down from the heav ens in the Firebirds of the Sun. Coming into the world, they found  no air for the breath of their souls. How shall we breathe? they asked of the Sun. And Sun gave them of His fire and beneath the earth they kindled the Blaze of the Great Wind. Good air roared from the womb of Mars our Mother, the ice burned with a great thunder, and there was air for the breath of Man. A thief, he was about to die like a thief. He hung from the post by his \\' wrists. The wan sunlight glistened faintly on his naked back as he waited, eyes tightly closed, lips moving slowly as he pressed his face against the rough wood and stood on tiptoe to relieve the growing ache in his shoulders. When his ankles ached, he hung by the nails that pierced his forearms just above the wrists. He was young, perhaps in his tenth Marsyear, and his crisp black hair was close-cropped in the fashion of the bachelor who had not et sired a pup, or not yet admitted that he had. Lithe and sleek, with the quick knotty muscles and slender rawhide limbs of a wild thing, halffed and hungry with a quick furious hunger that crouched in ambush. His face, though twisted with pain and fright, remained that of a cocky pup. When he opened his eyes he could see the low hills of Mars, sunwashed and gray-green with trees, trees brought down from the heavens by the Ancient Fathers. But he could also see the executioner in the foreground, sitting spraddlelegged and calm while he chewed a blade #G of grass and waited, A squat man with a thick face, he occasionally peered at the thief with empty blue eyes -- while he , casually played mumblety-peg with the bleedingblade. His stare was blank. \"Ready for me yet, Asir?\" he grumbled, not unpleasantly. The knifeman sat beyond spitting range, but Asir spat, and tried to wipe his chin on the post. \"Your dirty mother!\" he mumbled. The executioner chuckled and played mumblety-peg. After three hours of dangling from the spikes that pierced his arms, Asir was weakening, and the blood throbbed hard in his temples, with each jolt of his heart a separate pulse of pain. The red stickiness had stopped oozing down his arms; they knew how fo drive the spike just right. But the heartbeats labored in his head like a hammer beating at red-hot iron. How many heartbeats in a lifetime -- and how many left to him now? He whimpered and writhed, beginning to lose all hope. Mara had gone to see the Chief Commoner, to plead with him for the pilferers life -- but Mara was about as trustworthy as a wild hiiffen, and he had visions of them chuckling together in Tokra\\'s villa over a glass of amber wine, while life drained slowly from a young .thief. Asir regretted nothing. His father had been a renegade before him, had squandered his last ritual formula to buy a wife, then impoverished, had taken her away to the hills. Asir was bom in the hills, but he came back to the village of his ancestors to work as a servant and steal the rituals of his masters. No thief could last for long. A ritual-thief caused havoc in the community. The owner of a holy phrase, not knowing that it had been stolen, tried to spend it -- and eventually counter-claims would come to light, and a general accounting had to be called. The thief was\\' always found out. Asir had stolen more than wealth, he had stolen the strength of their souls. For this they hung him by his wrists and waited for him to beg for the bleeding-blade. Woman thirsts for husband Man thirsts for wife Baby thirsts for breast-milk Thief thirsts for knife... A rhyme from his childhood, a childish chant, an eenie-meenieminey for determining who should drink first from a nectar-cactus. He groaned and tried to shift his weight more comfortably. Where was Mara? II the squat man asked. Asir hated him with narrowed eyes. The executioner was bound by law to wait until his victim requested his fate. But Asir remained ignorant of what the fate would be. The Council of Senior Kinsmen judged him in  secret, and passed sentence as to what the executioner would do with the knife. But Asir was not informed of their judgment. He knew only that when he asked for it, the executioner would advance with the bleeding-blade and exact the punishment -- nis life, or an amputation, depending on the judgment. He might lose only an eye or an ear or a finger. But on the other hand, he might lose his life, both arms, or his masculinity. There was no way to find out until he asked for the punishment; If he refused to ask, they would leave him hanging there. In theory, a thief could escape by hanging four days, after which the execu- tioner would pull out the nails. Sometimes a culprit managed it but when the nails were pulled, the thing that toppled was already a corpse. The sun was sinking in the west, and it blinded him. Asir knew about the sun -- knew things the stupid council failed to know. A thief, if successful, frequently be came endowed with wisdom, for he memorized more wealth than a score of honest men. Quotations from the ancient gods-Fermi, Einstein, Elgermann, Hanser and the rest -- most men owned scattered phrases, and scattered phrases remained meaningless. But a thief memorized all transactions that he overheard, and the countless phrases could be fitted together into meaningful ideas. He knew now that Mars, once dead, was dying again, its air leaking away once more into space. And Man would die with it, unless something were done, and done quickly. The Blaze of the Great Wind needed to be rekindled under the earth, but it would not be done. The tribes had fallen into ignorance, even as the holy books had warned : It is realized that the colonists will be unable to maintain a tech-nology without basic tools  and that a rebuilding will require severa! generations of intelligently directed effort. Given the knowledge the colonists may he able to festore a machine culture if the knowledge continues to be bolsteted by desire. But if the thirds fourth and Nth generations fail to further the gtadual retooling process, the knowledge will become worthless. The quotation was from the god Roggins, Progress of the Mars-Cul ture, and he had stolen bits of it from various sources. The books themselves were no longer in existence, remembered only in memorized ritual chants, the possession of which meant wealth. Asir Was sick. Pain and slow loss of blood made him weak, and his vision blurred. He failed to see her Coming until he heard her feet rustling in the dry grass. \"Mara -- \" She smirked and spat contemptuously at the foot of the post. The daughter of a Senior Kinsman, she was a tall, slender girl with an arrogant strut and mocking eyes. She stood for a moment with folded, arms, eyeing him with amusement. Then, slowly, one eye closed in a solemn wink. She turned her back on him and spoke to the executioner. \"May I taunt the prisoner, Slnbil?\" she asked. \"It is forbidden to speak ,to the thief,\" growled the knifeman. \"Is he ready to beg for justice, Slubil?\" The knifeman grinned and looked at Asir. \"Are you ready for me yet, thief?\" Asir hissed an insult. The girl had betrayed him. \"Evidently a coward,\" she said. \"Perhaps he means to hang four days.\" \"Let him then.\" \"NoI think that I should like to see him beg.\" She gave Asir a long searching glance, then turned to walk away. The thief cursed her quietly and followed her with his eyes, A dozen steps away she stopped again, looked back over her shoulder, and repeated the slow wink. Then she marched on toward her father\\'s house. The wink made his scalp crawl for a moment, but then... Suppose she hasn\\'t betrayed me? Suppose she had wheedled the sentence out of Tokra, and knew what his punishment would be. I think that I should like to see him beg. But on the other hand, the fickle she-devil might be tricking him into asking for a sentence that she knew would be death or dismemberment -- just to amuse herself. He cursed inwardly and trembled as he peered at the bored executioner. He licked his lips and fought against dizzyness as he groped for words. Slubil heard him muttering and looked up. \"Are you ready for me yet?\" A sir dosed his eyes and gritted his teeth. \"Give it to me!\" he yelped suddenly, and braced himself against the post. Why not? The short time gained couldn\\'t be classed as living. Have it done with. Eternity would be sweet in comparison to this ignomy. A knife could be a blessing... He heard the executioner chuckle and stand up. He heard the man\\'s footsteps approaching slowly, and the singing hiss of the knife as Slubil swung it in quick arcs. The executioner moved about him slowly, teasing him with the whistle of steel fanning the air about him. He was expected to beg. Slubil occasionally laid the knife against his skin and took it away again. Then Asir heard the rustle of the executioner\\'s cloak as his arm went back. Asir opened his eyes. The executioner grinned as he held the blade high -- aimed at Asir\\'s head! The girl had tricked him. He groaned and closed his eyes again, muttering a half-forgotten prayer. The stroke fell -- and the blade chopped into the post above his head, Asir fainted. When he awoke he lay in a crumpled heap on the ground. The executioner rolled him over with his foot. \"In view of your extreme youth, thief,\" the knifeman growled, \"the council has ordered you perpetually banished. The sun is setting. Let dawn find you in the hills. If you return to the plains, you will be chained to a wild hiiffen and dragged to death,\" Panting weekly, Asir groped at his forehead, and found a fresh wound, raw and rubbed with rust to make a scar. Slubil had marked him as an outcast. But except for the nailholes through his forearms, he was still in one piece. His hands were numb, and he could scarcely move his fingers. Slubil had bound the spike-wounds, but the bandages were bloody and leaking. When the knifeman had gone, Asir climbed weakly to his feet. Several of the townspeople stood nearby, snickering at him. He ignored their catcalls and staggered toward the outskirts of the village ten rninuljes away. He had to speak to Mara, and to her father if the crusty oldster would listen. Mis thief s knowledge weighed upon him and brought desperate fear. Darkness had fallen by the time he came to Welkir\\'s house. The people spat at him in the streets, and some of them flung handfuls of loose dirt after him as he passed. A light flickered feebly through Welkifs door. Asir rattled it and waited. Welkir came with a lamp. He set the lamp on the floor and stood with feet spread apart, arms folded, glaring haughtily at the thief. His face was stiff as weathered stone. He said nothing, but only stared Contemptuously. Asir bowed his head. \\'T have come to plead with you Senior Kinsman.\\' Welkir snorted disgust. \"Against the mercy we have shown you?\" He looked up quickly, shaking his head. \"No! For that I am grateful.\" \"What then?\" \"As a thief, I acquired much wisdom. I know that the World is dying, and the air is boiling out of it into the sky. I wish to be heard by the council. We must study the words of the ancients and perform their magic, lest our children\\'s children be born to strangle in a dead world \" Welkir snorted again. He picked up the lamp. \"He who listens to a thief\\'s wisdom is cursed. He who acts upon it is doubly cursed and a party to the crime.\\' \"The vaults,\" Asir insisted. \"The \\'key to the Blaze of the Winds is in the vaults. The god Roggins tells us in the words -- \"Stop! I will not hear!\" \"Very well, but the blaze can be rekindled, and the air renewed. The vaults -- \" He stammered and shook his head. \"The council must heat me.\" \"The council will hear nothing, and you shall be gone before dawn. And the vaults are guarded by the sleeper called Big Joe. To enter is to die. Now go away,\" slammed the door, Asir sagged in defeat. He sank down on the doorstep to rest a moment. The night was black, except for lampflickers from an occasional window. \"Ssssst!\" A sound from the shadows. He looked around quickly, searching for the source. \"Ssssst! Asir!\" It was the \"girl Mara, Welkifs daughter. She had slipped out the back of the house ana was peering at him around the corner. He arose quietly and went to her. \"What did Slubil do to you?\" she whispered. Asir gasped and caught her shoulders angrily. \"Don\\'t yOu know? \"No! Stop! You\\'re hurting me. Tokra wouldn\\'t tell me. I made love to him, but he wouldn\\'t tell.\" He released her with an angry curse. \"You had to take It sometime\" she hissed. \"I knew if you waited you would be too weak from hanging to even run away.\" He called her a foul name, \"Ingrate I\" she snapped. \"And I bought you a hiiffen!\" \"You what?\\' \"Tokra gave me a ritual phrase and I bought you a hiiffen with it. You can\\'t walk to the hills, you know.\" Asir burned with dull rage. \"You slept with Tokra!\" he snapped, \"You\\'re jealous!\" she tittered. \"How can I be jealous! I hate the sight of you!\" \"Very well then, I\\'ll keep the hiiffen.\" he growled. \"I won\\'t need it, since I\\'rti not going to the hills!\" She gasped. \"You\\'ve got to go, you fool! They\\'ll kill you!\" He turned away, feeling sick. She caught at his arm and tried to pull him back. \\'Asir! Take the hiiffen and \"I\\'ll go,\" he growled. \"But not to the hills. I\\'m going out to the vault.\" He stalked away, but she trotted along beside him, trying to tug him back. \"Fool! The vaults are sacred! The priests guard the entrance, and the Sleeper guards the inner door. They\\'ll kil you if you try it, and if you linger, the council will kill you tomorrow.\" \"Let them!\" he snarled. \"I am no sniveling townsman! I am of the hills, and my father was a renegade. Your council had no right to judge me. Now I shall judge themj The words were spoken hotly, and he realized their folly. He expected a scornful rebuke from Mara, but she hung onto his arm and pleaded with him. He had dragged her a dozen doorways from the house of her father. Her voice had lost its arrogance and became pleading. \"Please, Asir! Go away. Listen! I will even go with you -- if you want me. He laughed harshly. \"Tokra\\'s leavings.\" She slapped him hard across the mouth. \"Tokra is an impotent old dodderer. He can scarcely move for arthritis. You\\'re an idiot! I sat on his lap and kissed his bald pate for you.\" \"Then why did he give you a ritual phrase?\" he asked stiffly. \"Because he likes me.\" \"You lie.\" He stalked angrily on. \"Very well! Go to the vaults. I\\'ll tell my father, and they\\'ll hunt you down before you get there.\" She released his arm and stopped. Asir hesitated. She meant it. He came back to her slowly, then slipped his swollen hands to her throat. She did not back away. \"Why don\\'t I just choke you and leave you lying here?\" he hissed. Her face was only a shadow in darkness, but he could see her cool smirk. \"Because you love me, Asir of Franic.\" He dropped his hands and grunt- ed a low curse. She\\' laughed low and took his arm, \"Come on. We\\'ll go get the hiiffen,\" she said. Why not? he thought. Take her hiiffen, and take her too. He could dump her a few miles from the village, then circle back to the vaults. She leaned against him as they moved back toward her father\\'s house, then skirted it and stole back to the field behind the row of dwellings. Phobos hung low in the westj its tiny disk lending only a faint glow to the darkness. He heard the hiifFen\\'s breathing as they approached a hulking shadow in the gloom. Its great wings Snaked out #owly as it sensed their approach, and it made a low piping sound. A native Martian species, it bore no resemblance to the beasts that the ancients had brought with them from the sky. Its back was Covered with a thin shell like a beetles, but its belly was porous and soft. It digested food by sitting on it, and absorbing it. The wings were bony -- parchment stretched across a fragile frame. It Was headless, and lacked a centralized brain the nervous functions being distributed. T he great creature made no protest as they climbed up the broad flat back and strapped themselves down with the belts that had been threaded through holes cut in the hiifTen\\'s thin, tough shell. Its lungs slowly gathered a tremendous breath of air, causing the riders , to rise up as the huge air-sacs became distended. The girth of an inflated hiiffen was nearly four times as great as when deflated. When the air was gathered, the creature began to shrink again as its muscles tightened, compressing the breath until a faint leakage-hiss came from behind. It waited, wings taut. The girl tugged at a ring set through the flem of its flank. There was a blast of sound and a jeVk. Nature\\'s experiment in jet propulsion soared ahead and turned into the wind Its first breath exhausted, it gathered another arid blew itself ahead again. The ride was jerky. Each tail ward belch was a rough lurch. They let the huffen choose its own heading as it gained altitude. Then Mara tugged at the wingstraps, and the creature wheeled to soar toward the dark hills in the distance. Asir sat behind her, a sardonic smirk on his face, as the wind whipped about them. He waited until they had flown beyond screaming distance of the village. Then he took her shoulders lightly in his hands. Mistaking it for affection, she leaned back against him easily and rested her dark head on his Moulder. He kissed her--\"while his hand felt gingerly for the knife at her belt. His fingers were numb but he managed to clutch dt, and press the blade lightly against her throat. She gasped. With his other hand, he caught her hair. \"Now guide the hiiffen down!\\' he ordered. \"Quickly!\" he barked. \"What are you going to do?\" \"Leave you here and circle back to the vaults.\" \"No! Not out here at night!\" He hesitated. There were slinking prowlers on the Cimmerian plain, beasts who would regard the marooned daughter of Welkir a delicious bit of good fortune, a gustatory delight of a sort they seldom were able to enjoy. Even above the moap of the wind, he could hear an occasional howLcry from the fanged welcoming committee that waited for its dinner beneath them. \\'Very well,\" he growled reluctantly. \"Turn toward the vaults. But one scream and I#I slice you.\" He took the blade from her throat but kept the point touching her back. \"Please, Asir, no!\" she pleaded. \"Let me go on to the hills. Why do you want to go to the vaults? Because of Tokra?\" He gouged her with the point until she yelped. \"Tokra be damned, and you with him!\" he snarled. \"Turn back,\" \"I\\'m going down to kindle the Blaze of the Winds.\" \"You\\'re mad The spirits of the ancients live in the vaults.\" \"I am going to kindle the Blaze of the Winds,\" he insisted stubbornly. \"Now either turn back, or go down and I\\'ll turn back alone.\" A fter a hesitant moment, she tugged at a wing-rein and the hiiffen banked majestically. They flew a mile to the south of the village, then beyond it toward the cloister where the pdests of Big Joe guarded the entrance to the vaults. The cloister was marked by a patch of faint light on the ground ahead. \"Circle around it once,\" he ordered. \"You can\\'t get in. They\\'ll kill you.\" He doubted it. No one ever tried to enter, except the priests who carried small animals down as sacrifices to the great Sleeper. Since no outsider ever dared go near the shaft, the gixards expected no one. He doubted that Aey would be alert. The cloister was a hollow square widi a small stone tower rising in the center of the courtyard. The tower contained the entrance to the shaft. In the dim light of Phobos, assisted by yellow flickers from the cloister windows, he peered at the courtyard as they circled closer. It seeiiied to be empty. \"Land beside the tower #\\' he ordered. \"Asir -- please -- \" \"Do it!\" The hiiffen plunged rapidly, soared across the outer walls, and burst into the courtyard. It landed with a rough jolt and began squeaking plaintively. \"Hurry!\" hp hissed. \"Get your straps off and let\\'s go.\" \"I\\'m not going.\" A prick of the knife, point changed her mind. They slid quickly to the ground, and Asir kicked the hiiffen in the flanks. The beast sucked in air and burst aloft. Startled faces were trying to peer through the lighted cloister windows into the courtyard. Someone cried a challenge. Asir darted to the door of the tower and dragged it open. Now forced to share the danger, the girl came with him without urging. They stepped into a stairlanding. A candle flickered from a wall bracket. A guard, sitting on the floor beneath the candle glanced up in complete surprise. Then he reached for a short barbed pike. Asir kicked him hard in the temple, then rolled his limp form outside. Men witji torches were running across the courtyard. He slammed the heavy metal door and bolted it. Fists began beating on the door. They paused for a moment to rest, and Mara stared at him in fright. He expected her to burst into angry speech, but she only leaned against the wall and panted. The dark mouth of the stairway yawned at them -- a stone throat that led into the bowels of Mars and the realm of the monster, Big Joe. He glanced at Mara thoughtfully, and felt sorry for her. \\'T can leave you here,\" he offered, \"but I\\'ll have to tie you.\" She moistened her lips, glanced first at the stairs, then at the door where the guards were raising a frantic howl. She shook her head. \\'T\\'ll go with you.\" \"The priests won\\'t bother you, if they see that you were a prisoner.\\' I\\'ll go with you.\" He was pleased, but angry with himself for the pleasure. An arrogant, spiteful, conniving wench, he told himself. She\\'d lied about Tokra. He grunted gruffly, seized the candle, and started down the stairs. When she started after him, he stiffened and glanced back, remembering the barbed pike. As he had suspected, she had f ucked it up. The point was a foot rom the small of his back. They stared at each other, and she wore her self-assured smirk. \"Here,\" she said, and handed it casually. \"You might need this.\\' T hey stared at each other again, but it was different this time. Bewildered, he shook his head and resumed the descent toward the vaults. The guards were battering at the door behind them. The stairwell was damp and cold. Blackness folded about them like a shroud. They moved in silence, and after five thousand steps, Asir stopped counting. Somewhere in the depths, Big Joe slept his restless sleep. Asir wondered grimly how long it would take the guards to tear down the metal door. Somehow they had to get past Big Joe before the guards came thundering after them. There was a way to get around the monster: of that he was certain. A series of twenty-four numbers was involved, and he had memorized them with a stolen bit of ritual. How to use them was a different matter. He imagined vaguely that one must call them out in a loud voice before the inner entrance. The girl walked beside him now, and he could feel her shivering. His eyes were quick and nervous as he scanned each pool of darkness, each nook and cranny along the stairway wall. The well was silent except for the mutter of their footsteps, and the gloom was full of musty odors. The candle afforded little light. \"I told you the truth about Tokra,\" she blurted suddenly. Asir glowered straight ahead and said nothing, embarrassed by his previous jealousy. They moved on in silence. Suddenly she stopped. \"Look,\" she hissed, pointing down ahead. He shielded the candle with his hand and peered downward toward a small square of dim light. \"The bottom of the stairs,\" he muttered. The light seemed faiht and diffuse, with a slight greenish cast. Asir blew out the candle, and the girl quickly protested. \"How will we see to climb again?\" He laughed humorlessly. \"What makes you think we will?\" She moaned and clutched at his arm, but came with him as he descended slowly toward the light. The stairway opened into a long corridor whose ceiling was faintly luminous. White-faced and frightened, they paused on the bottom step and looked down the corridor. Mara gasped and covered her eyes. \"Big Joe!\" she whispered in awe,. He stared through the stairwell door and doyn the corridor through another door into a large room. Big Joe sat in the center of the room, sleeping his sleep of ages amid a heap of broken and whitening bones. A creature of metal, twice the height of Asir, he had obviously been designed to kill. Trifingered hands with gleaming talons, and a monstrous head shaped like a Marswolf, with long silver fangs. Why should a metalcreature have fangs, unless he had been built to kill? The behemoth slept in a crouch, waiting for the intruders. He tugged the girl through the stairwell door. A voice droned out of nowhere: \"# you have come to plunder, go back! He stiffened, looking around. The girl whimpered. \"Stay here by the stairs,\" he told her, and pushed her firmly back through the door. Asir started slowly toward the room where Big Joe waited. Beyond the room he could see another door, and the monster\\'s job was appalrently to keep intruders back from the inner vaults where, according to the ritual chants, the Blaze of the Winds could be kindled. \\' Halfway along the corridor, the voice called out again, beginning a kind of sing-song chant; \"Big Joe will kill you. Big Joe will kill you. Big Joe will kill you -- He turned slowly, searching for the speaker. But the voice seemed to come from a black disk on the wall. The talking-machines perhaps, as mentioned somewhere in the ritual. A few paces from the entrance to the room, the voice fell silent. He stopped at the door, staring in at the monster. Then he took a deep breath and began chanting the twenty-four numbers in a loud but quavering voice. Big Joe remained in his motionless crouch. Nothing happened. He stepped through the doorway. B ig joe emitted a deafening roar, straightened with a metallic groan, and lumbered toward him, taloned hands extended and eyes blazing furiously. Asir shrieked and ran for his life. Then he saw Mara lying sprawled in the stairway entrance. She had fainted. Blocking an impulse to leap over her and flee alone, he stopped to lift her. But suddenly he realized that there was no pursuit. He looked back. Big Joe had returned to his former position, and he appeared to be asleep again. Puzzled, Asir stepped back into the corridor. \"# you have come to plunder, go backy He moved gingerly ahead again. \"Big Joe will kill you, Big Joe will kill you, Big Joe will kill -- He recovered the barbed Dike f from the floor and stole into the .#one of silence. This time he stopped to look around. Slowly he reached the pike-staff through the doorway. Nothing happened. He stepped closer and waved it around inside. Big Joe remained motionless. Then he dropped the point of the pike to the floor. The monster bellowed and started to rise. A sir leaped backy scalp crawling. But Big Joe settled back in his crouch. Fighting a desire to flee Asir reached the pike through the door and rapped it on the floor again. This time nothing happened. He glanced down. The pike\\'s point rested in the center of a gray floors tile, just to the left of the entrance. The floor was a checkerboard pattern of gray and white. He tapped another gray square, and this time the monster started out of his drowse again. After a moment\\'s thought, he began touching each tile within reach of the door. Most of them brought a response from Big Joe. He found four that did not. He knelt down before the door to peer at them closely. The first was unmarked. The second bore a dot in the center. The third bore two, and the fourth three -- in order of their distance from the door. He stood up and stepped inside again, standing on the fifst tile. Big Joe remained motionless. He stepped diagonally left to the sec ond -- straight ahead to the third- -- then diagonally right to the fourth. He stood there for a moment, trembling and staring at the Sleeper. He was four feet past the door! Having assured himself that the monster was still asleep, he crouched to peer at the next tiles. He stared for a long time, but found no similar markings. Were the dots coincidence? He reached out with the pike, then drew it back. He was too close to the Sleeper to risk a mistake. He stood up and looked around care fully, noting each detail of the room -- and of the floor in particular. He counted the rows and colximns of tiles- -- twenty-four each way. Twenty-four -- and there were twenty-four numbers in the series that was somehow connected with safe passage through the room. He frowned and muttered through the series to himself -- # , I , # , # , # , #  ## I . The first four numbers -- #, #. And the tiles -- the first with nO dots, the second with one, the third with two, the fourth with three. But the four tiles were\\' not in a straight line, and there Were no marked ones beyond the fourth. He backed out of the room and studied them from the end of the corridor again.  Mara had come dizriiy awake and was calling for him weakly. He replied reassuringly and turned to his task again. \"First tile, then diagonally left, then straight, then diagonally right -- -\" #, #, #, #. A hunch came. He advanced as far as the second tile, then reached as far ahead as he could and touched the square diagonally right from the fourth one. Big Joe re mained motionless but began to speak. His scalp bristled at the growling voice. \"If the intruder makes an err or , Joe will Standing tense, ready to leap back to the corridor, he touched the square again The motionless behemoth repeated the grim waming Asir tried to reach the square diagonally right from the fifth, but could not without stepping up to , the third. Taking a deep breath, he stepped up and extended the pike cautiously, keeping his eyes on Big Joe. The pike rapped the floor. \" the intruder makes an error, Big Joe will kill.\\' But the. huge figure remained in his place. square, the path went left, straight, right; right, right. And after zero, the numbers went #, #, #, #, #. Apparently he had found the key. One meant a square to the southeast; two meant south; and three southwest. Shivering, he moved up to the fifth square upon which the monster growled his first warning. He looked back at the. door, then at Big Joe. The taloned. hands could grab him before he could dive back into the corridor. He hesitated. He could either turn back now, or gamble his life on the accuracy of the tentative belief. The girl was calling to him again.  , \"Come to the end of the corri dor!\\' he replied. She came hurriedly, to his surprise. he bellowed. \"Stay back of the entrance! Not on the tile! Nor Slowly she withdrew the foot that hung poised over a triggertile. \"You can\\'t come in unless you know how,\" he gasped. She blinked at him and glanced nervously back over her shoulder. \"But I hear them. They\\'re coming down the stairs.\" Asir cursed softly. Now he had to go ahead. \"Wait just a minute,\" he said. \"Then ril show you how to come through.\" He advanced to the last tile that he had tested and stopped. The next two numbers were two -- for straight ahead. And they would take him within easy reach of, the long taloned arms of the murderous sentinel. He glanced around in fright at the crushed bones scattered across the floor. Some were human. Others were animal-sacrifices tossed in by the priests. He had tested only one two -- back near the door. If he made a mistake, he would never escape; no need bothering with the pike. He stepped to the next tile and closed his eyes. \" the intrurder makes an error, Big Joe will kilir He opened his eyes again and heaved a breath of relief. \"Asir! They\\'re getting closer! I can hear them!\" He listened for a moment, A faint murmur of angry voices in the distance. \"All right,\" he said calmly. \"Step only on the tiles I tell you. See the gray one at the left of the door?\" She pointed. \"This one?\" \"Yes, step on it.\" The girl moved up and stared fearfully at \\'the monstrous sentinel. He guided her up toward him. \"Diagonally left -- one ahead -- diagonally right. Now don\\'t be frightened when he speaks -- \" The girl came on until she stood one square behind him. Her quick frightened breathing blended with the growing sounds of shouting from the stairway. He glanced up at Big Joe, noticing for the first time that the steel jaws were stained with a red-brown crust. He shuddered. The grim chess-game continued a cautious step at a time, with the girl following one square behind him. What if she fainted again? And fell across a triggered tile? They passed within a foot of Big Joe\\'s arm. Looking up, he saw the monster\\'s eyes move -- following them, scrutinizing them as they passed. He froze. \"We want no plunder,\" he said to the machine. The gaze was steady and unwinking. \"The air is leaking away from the world.\" The monster remained silent. \"Hurry!\"\\' whimpered the girl. Their pursuers were gaining rapidly and they had crossed only half the distance to the opposing doorway. Progress was slower now, for Asir needed occasionally to repeat through the whole series of numbers, looking back to count squares and make certain that the next step was not a fatal one. \"They won\\'t dare to come in after us,\" he said hopefully. \"And if they do?\" \" the intruder makes an error. Big Joe will killj announced the machine as Asir took another step. \"Eight squares to go!\" he muttered, and stopped to count again. \"Asir! They\\'re in the corridor!\" Hearing the rumble of voices, he looked back to see blue-robed men the room. But halfway down the hall, the priests paused -- seeing the unbelievable; two intruders walking safely past their devil-god. They growled excitedly among themselves. Asir took another step. Again the machine voiced the monotonous warning. the intruder makes an error...\" H earing their deity speak, the priests of Big Joe babbled wildly and withdrew a little. But one, more impulsive than the rest, began shrieking. the intruders! Cut them down with your spears!\\' Asir glanced back to see two of themracing toward the room, lances cocked for the throw. If a spear struck a trigger-tile -- \"Stop!\" he bellowed, facing around. The two priests paused. Wondering if it would result in his sudden death, he rested a hand lightly against the huge steel arm of the robot, then leaned against it. The huge eyes were staring down at him, but Big Joe did not move. The spearmen stood frozen, gaping at the thief\\'s familiarity with the horrendous hulk. Then, slowly they backed away. Continuing his bluff, he looked up at Big Joe and spoke in a loud voice. \"If they throw their spears or try to enter, kill them He turned his back on the throng in the hall and continued the cautious advance. Five to go, four three, two --  He paused to stare into the room beyond. Gleaming machinery -- all silent -- \"and great panels, covered with a multitude of white circles and dials. His heart sank. If here lay the magic that controlled the Blaze of the Great Wind, he could never hope to re-kindle it. He stepped through the doorway, and the girl followed. Immediately the robot spoke like low thunder. \\'The identity of the two technologists is recognized. Hereafter they may pass with impunity. Big Joe is charged to ask the following: why do the technologists come whert it is not yet time? Staring back, Asir saw that the robot\\'s head had turned so that he was looking directly back at the thief and the girl. Asir also saw that someone had approached the door again. Not priests, but townspeople. He stared, recognizing the Chief Commoner, and the girl\\'s father Welkir, three other Senior JCinsmen, and -- Slubil, the executioner who had nailed hhn to the post \"Father! Stay back.\" Welkir remained silent, glaring at them. He turned and whispered to the Chief Commoner. The Chief Commoner whispered to Slubil. The executioner nodded grimly and took a short-axe from his belt thong. He stepped through the entrance, his left foot striking the zero-tile. He peered at Big Joe and saw that the monster remained motionless. He grinned at the ones behind him, then snarled in Asir\\'s direction. \"You\\'re sentence has been changed, thief.\" \"Don\\'t try to cross, Slubil!\" Asir barked, Slubil spat, brandished the axe, and stalked forward. Big Joe came up like a resurrection of fury, and his bellow was explosive in the vaults. Slubil froze, then stupidly drew back his axe. Asir gasped as the talons closed. He turned away quickly. Slubil\\'s scream was cut off abruptly by a ripping sound, then a series of dull cracks and snaps. The girl shrieked and closed her eyes. There were two distinct thuds as Big Joe tossed Slubil aside. The priests and the townspeople -- all except Welkir -- had fled from the corridor and up the stairway. Welkir was on his kneqs, his hands covering his face\\' \"Mara!\" he moaned. \"My daughter.\" \"Go back, Father,\" she called. Dazed, the old man picked himself up weakly and staggered down the corridor toward the stairway. When he passed the place of the first warning voice, the robot moved again -- arose slowly and turned toward Asir and Mara who backed quickly away, deeper into the room of strange machines. Big Joe carrfe lumbering slowly after them. Asir looked around for a place to flee, but the monster stopped in the doorway. He spoke again, a mechanical drone like memorized ritual. Big Joe is charged with announcing his function for the intelligence of the technologists. His primary function is to prevent the entrance of possibly destructive organisms into the vaults containing the control equipment for the fusion reaction which must periodically renew atmospheric oxygen. His secondary function is to direct the technologists to records containing such information as they may need. His tertiary function is to carry out simple directions given by the technologists if such directions are possible to his limited design. Asir stared at the lumbering creature and realized for the first time that it was not alive, but only a machine built by the ancients to perform specific tasks. Despite the fresh redness about his hands and jaws. Big Joe was no more guilty of SlubiPs death than a grinding mill would be if the squat sadist had climbed into it while the Marsoxen were yoked to the crushing roller. Perhaps the ancients had been unnecessarily brutal in building such a guard -- but at least they had built him to look like a destroyer, and to give ample warning to the intruder. Glancing around at the machinery, he vaguely understood the reason for Big Joe. Such metals as these would mean riclies for swordmakers and smiths and plunderers of all kinds. A sir straightened his shoulders and addressed the machine. \"Teach us how to kindle the Blaze of the Great Wind.\" caching is not within the designed functions of Big foe. I am charged to say: the renewal reaction should not be begun before the Marsyear #J)#, as th builders reckoned time. Asir frowned. The years were no longer numbered, but only named in honor of the Chief Commoners who ruled the villages. \"How long until the year #?\" he asked. Big Joe clucked like an adding machine. \"Twelve Marsyears, technologist.\" Asir stared at the complicated machinery. Could they learn to operate it in twelve years? It seemed impossible. \"How can we begin to learn?\" he asked the robot. This is an instruction room, where you may examine records. The control mechanisms are installed in the deepest vault. Asir froyned and walked to the far end of the hall where another door opened into -- another anteroom. with another Big Joe! As he approached the second robot spoke:  \" the intruder has not acquired the proper knowledge. Big Oswald will kilU\\' Thunderstruck, he leaped back from the entrance and swayed heavily against an instrument panel. The panel lit up and a polite recorded voice began reading something about \"President Snell\\'s role in the Eighth World War\". He lurched away from the panel and stumbled back toward Mara who sat glumly on the foundation slap of a weighty machine. \"What are you laughing about?\" she muttered. \"We\\'re still in the first grade!\" he groaned, envisioning a sequence of rooms. \"We\\'ll have to learn the magic of the tocients befcire we pass to the next\\' \"The ancients weren\\'t so great,\" she grumbled. \"Look at the mural on the wall.\" Asir looked, and saw only a strange design of circles about a bright splash of yellow that might have been the sun \"What about it?\" he asked. \"My father taught me about the planets,\" \\' she said. \"That is supposed to be the way they go around the sun.\" \"What\\'s wrong with It?\" \"One planet too many,\" she said. \"Everyone knows that there is only an asteroid belt between Mars and Venus. The picture shows a planet there.\" Asir shrugged indifferently, being interested only in the machinery\"Can\\'t you allow them one small mistake?\" \"I suppose.\" She paused, gazing miserably in the direction in which her father had gone. \"What do we do now?\" Asir considered it for a long tinie. Then he spoke to Big Joe. \"You Will come with us to the village\\' The machine was silent for a md ment, then: \"There is an apparent contradiction between primary and tertiary functions. Request priority decision by technologist Asir failed to understand. He re peated his request.\\' The robot turned slowly and stepped through the doorway. He waited. Asir grinned. \"Let\\'s go back up,\" he said to the girl. She arose eagerly. They crossed the anteroom to the corridor and began the long climb toward the surface, with Big Joe lumbering along behind. \"What about your banishment, Asir?\" she asked gravely. \"Wait and see\\' He envisioned the pandemonium that would reign when girl, man, and robot marched through the village to the council house, and he chuckled. \"I think that I shall be the next Chief Commoner,\" he Said. \"And my councilmen will all be thieves.\" \"Thieves!\" she gasped, \"Why?\" \"Thieves who are not afraid to steal the knowledge of the gods tad beCorne technologists, to kindle the Bla#e of the Winds.\" \"What is a \\'technologist\\', Asir?\" she asked worshipfully. Asir glowered at himself for bluridering with words he did not understand, but could not admit ignorance to Mara who clung tightly to his arm. \"I think,\" he said, \"that a technologist is a thief who tells the gods what to do.\" \"Kiss me, Technologist,\" she told him in a small voice Big Joe clanked to a stop to wait for them to move on. He waited a long time. Here was a test for the bravest of explorers. A monster that prowled a grim planet and hid behind phantoms. , By John W. Jakes  T he forward cabin of the little ship was unbearably hot. Corrigan and Wingfield sat stripped to the waist, their fingers working numbly on the keys of the data recorders in each wall. Beyond the curving glass of the cabin window lay the arid noonday wilderness of the tiny world, a rocky jumbled wasteland sweltering under an immense yellow sun. Corrigan sighed loudly and pushed back his sandy hair. \"Joe, I quit. Its just too\" damned hot.\" Wingfield, a squat dark-haired man with large black eyes and a weak, shapeless mouth, turned around and stared at him. \"Cut it outj\\'Vince,\" he said in a wheedling tone. \"WeVe only got two more days to chart this place and move on. After all, there are six more hunks of stuff around this sun, and weVe got to do them all this trip.\" Wearily, Corrigan nodded and turned back to the keys. They were filmed with a faint coating of sweat. If all the other six are like this, Corrigan thought grimly, we\\'ll go nuts. Nothing but heat and yellow desert. No life of any kind, or at least none we\\'ve seen. Well, it would be better to get it over. He set his fingers down on the keys and began to type, wrinkling his nose at the fetid sweaty smell of the cabin. He wondered idly how long it would be before the walls melted. A few minutes later .Wingfield spoke to him. \"Hey, Vince.\" Corrigan turned around again, grateful for the relief. \"What is it?\" \\'T just thought of something. Morse isn\\'t back yet.\" iDorrigan frowned. \"He can take care of himself. Where\\' d he go?\" \"Out to check some of the rock formations up the hill.\" Corrigan gestured aimlessly. \"Don\\'t worry,\" Morse was a big f:?\\'tXf C#?# Sztrpfjt man, Keavy-bodied and efficient. Of them all, Corrigan thought -- K)f the three of them in Galactic Mapping Ship Number EighteenMorse was the most capable. \"That was an hour and a half ago,\" Wingfield said scowling. \"He should be back. I -- I didn\\'t think about it. I got so busy working that I didn\\'t remember about him.\" \"It\\'s too hot for thinking,\" Corrigan said sourly \"Your brains fry.\" He got up from the recorder. \"Come on, let\\'s go have a look. Only don\\'t bitch about not getting any work done.\" Deep down, Corrigan was glad for a chance to go outside, even if the heat was worse. The routine monotony of the job was beginning to wear on all of them. Wingfield reached into a wall locker and extracted one of the bigbarreled magnesium fire rifles. \"I think I\\'ll take this along,\" he said as they headed for the port. \"Just in case.\" \"There isn\\'t anything to shoot,\" Corrigan said, pulling the port open. \"Not a living thing. Just rocks and desert and that sun.\" He dropped to the ground and immediately felt the blood begin to heat within his body. Fifty yards below the place where the ship lay settled on the side of the hill, the bluff dropped away steeply. And far down lay the desolate yellow wasteland of a valley. That valley as yet remained unexplored. T hey went around the ship, Corrigan in front, and started up the hillside. They picked their way among the large porous boulders, each of them the same yellowish hue of the sun. They had gone about five hundred yards when Corrigan stopped, sniffing. His stomach turned over inside of him. \"Wingfield,\" he said. \"Smell that?\" Wingfield turned his head from side to side. \"Sweet , . he said softly. \"I\\'ve smelled that stuff before, or something like it. What is it?\" Corrigan leaned up against a boulder and looked straight at his companion. \"You\\'ll think I\\'m crazy, but it smells like some kind of dope. Martian hashish, maybe. I\\'ve smelled it in plenty of dives back in the System.\" Wingfield nodded. \"It\\'s not exactly the same, though. There\\'s something -- well -- \" He fumbled for a word and then laughed sheepishly. \" -- different.\" Corrigan thought silently for a minute. He gazed up at the yellow ball of the sun and said, \"That means something grows in this place. Something\\'s alive,\" to make that smell.\" , \"I don\\'t know,\" Wingfield said dubiously. \"It might be anything. You can\\'t make inferences about life outside our System on the basis  of our own reference points. Things can just be too different.\" \"We never smelled it before!\" Corrigan said testily. \"I think we\\'d better look for Morse.\" He started up the hill. They reached the top of the hill and looked around. Corrigan went in one direction, Wingfield the opposite way. They searched through the fallen jumble of yellow rocks fbr ten minutes. Then Corrigan heard Wingfield calling him. \"Hey Vince. Gome here Quick #\" He went at a trot. He could #ee Wingfield\\'s head above one of the boulders. Wingfield was staring at the ground, his eyes wide with sick horror. Corriganjumped a pile of small boulders and came up to him. \"What\\'s wrong, Joe, what -- \\' Corrigan looked down. It was Morse, lying on his back eyes wide open as he stared unblinkingly into the heart of the yellow sun. He\\'d been cutj slashed mutilated to a point beyond all comprehension. \"His lips are moving,\\' Corrigan whispered. \"Look at them.\" \"Maybe he\\'s trying tO tell tife something.\" Corrigan knelt down, trying t# keep from feeling sick. He put his ear Close to Morse\\'s mouth and listened. A minute later he got up and faced Wingfield. \"He keeps mumbling. I caught a couple of things. He said Mg and black dfhimdl and I saw my wife \"The heat,\" Wingfield muttered thinly. \"The heat got him. He fell.\" \"Don\\'t be stupid,\" Corrigan snarled. \"Something tore his belly open. Something Morse was scrabbling in the yeb low dust, trying to raise himself on his elbows. He screamed in a final burst of strength. \"I saw my wife! I saw her!\" And then he fell back, A fine powdery cloud of yellow dust rose about his body. He would not speak nor move again. \"Something alive killed him,\" Corrigan said again. The narcotic smell of the air made him sick. He tried to think clearly Wingfield stood by, staring at the Corpse Who had been their friend, holding tightly to the stock of the magnesium rifle. \"I guess we\\'d better go back to the ship and find something to bury him with,\" Corrigan said, thinking aloud. He hesitated. \"No -- we could put him in the refrigerator locker and take him back to the System for burial. I think -- Suddenly, Wingfield yClled out -- incoherently. where his companion pointed. His eyes swept up the curve of the large boUlder directly above them. His body went cold, even in the heat of the yellow sun. Wingfield made little whimpering noises. The beast crouched on top of the boulder, Watching them with huge bonfire eyes. It was over twelve feCt long, built like some fantastic dark panther, with burnished ebony flanks that shone in the sunlight. A long barbed tail switched in the air behind it. Its clawfe caressed the surface Of the boulder, making tiny scratching sounds, and its jaws hung open. Corrigan and Wingfield stood frozen, watching the alien thing in horror. Corrigan could see the blood on its Claws, smell the overpowering narcotic odor rising from its skin. Slowly the muscles in its hide began to ripple. Corrigan knew it was going to spring. Wingfield was somewhere behind him with the rifle. Corrigan whispered loudly, \"Shoot, Joe.\" He heard Wingfield giggle, \"It\\'s Tommy. Hello, Tommy. And Jane. What are you two doing here?\\' The beast was rising now, gathering strength to come slashing dpwn on them in its black sleek fury. Corrigan whirled around. The magnesium rifle lay where it had fallen and Wingfield was giggling and pointing his finger at the side of the boulder. \"Hello Tommy boy, how are you?\\' \"Joe!\" Corrigan grated. \"Pick up -- He stopped. Behind him he heard the beast snarl. There was no time for Wingfield now. Corrigan leaped forward, shoving him out of the way. One hand scooped up the rifle even as he was turning. The beast leaped from the boulder as Corrigan raised the rifle. The black body was above him when he slapped the trigger bar. A ball of white fire whined upward and smashed into the black stomach. The beast squalled as Corrigan dived from its path. Then it was gone. Corrigan\\'s shot had saved his own life but it hadn\\'t bagged the game. Shaken, he turned to Wingfield who wis nodding his head vacantly. \"Why didn\\'t you use the rifle?\" Corrigan said angrily. \"I couldn\\'t. My little boy Tommy was standing right there with Jane -- plain as day.\" He pointed at the boulder. \"You\\'re crazy,\" Corrigan said. He felt weak and terrified from the experience. He wondered if he had killed the beast or merely wounded it. \"We\\'d better get back to the ship,\" he said. Wingfield nodded emptily. \"I\\'m sure it was they,\" he said. Corrigan had his own ideas. As he trudged along, he thought of the tiny blue Martian tkriss cats who possessed the power of seeking into a human mind, lighting upon a thought-image and conjuring it up by some hypnotic process before the watcher\\'s eyes. The beast was evidently a much higher variation of the phenomenon. f  Corrigan noticed large sticky stains on the sand at mgular intervals. He knelt down and sniffed. The narcotic stench filled his nostrils. He got up and said to Wingfield, \"I shot the thing in the stomach. It must still be alive.\" \"Xiisten, Vince,\" Wingfield protested, \"I saw Tommy and Jane. I swear to God I did. Please believe me! And what was it that Morse said? He saw his wife?\" \"I believe you,\" Corrigan said. His mind raced ahead. The wound trail led down the hill past the ship and over the edge of the bluff. Leaving Wingfield outside, Corrigan hurried into the ship and returned with field glasses. The two men went to the edge of the bluff and Corrigan raised the glasses to his eyes, staring down to the yellow sunburnt valley. ThereT he exclaimed. The beast was moving slowly over the floor of the valley, its black coat simmering in the sun, the trail of narcotic life fluid leaking from the wound along the ground. He turned to Wingfield. \"We\\'ve got to go after it. Right now.\" \"W -- what?\" \"You heard rtle.\" \"Vince, we can\\'t!\" Wingfield\\'s fate contorted in terror. \"It\\'ll kill us. There\\'s no sense. Look what it did to Morse. His stomach -- oh -- \\' He covered his face with his hands. \"I\\'m going anyway,\" Corrigan said. \"It\\'s wounded. It can be killed. And it may come back.\" Wingfield clutched his arm. \"You wouldn\\'t leave me alone, would you?\" \"I\\'m going after it,\" Corrigan said stubbornly, remembering the way Morse had laughed with them the night before. \"You can do as you like.\" Slowly Wingfield\\'s shoulders formed a defeated curve. \"I\\'ll go with you,\" he muttered. \"What other choice have I got?\" Corrigan said nothing. The two men stood on the lip of the cliff for a few more minutes, gazing out at the yellow alien desert below where the black dot that was the beast moved slowly, painfully toward the bluffs ringing the desert on the opposite side. Corrigan wondered absently what image the beast would pick from his mind. Probably his wife, back in the System. He remembered her accurately. Slender, corn-colored hair, die slightly prominent nose, the always-smiling mouth. The beast was clever. It could keep its fiery yellow desert kingdom to itself, free from alien invaders in silver rockets. Create the image, confuse, and divert attention. The frightened victim feared for himself as well as for the terribly real image, suddenly created and dreadfully concrete. \"Lord!\" Corrigan muttered, \"can any man stand against it?\" He knew full well what Wingfield had gone through. And Morse, before he had died. \"We\\'d better get started,\\' he said. \"And we\\'d better take a couple of extra rifles along.\" They started back up the hill toward the ship. The round yellow sun burned down on their backs, making the sweat run. Corrigan thought of the beast and wondered how he would feel when they caught up with it, watching his wife being stalked. Could he remember the image was not real? He won dered -- about both himself and Wingfield. They picked up enough food supplies from the rocket to last them overnight. Wingfield strapped the pack onto his back. Corrigan took two fully loaded magnesium fire rifles in addition to the one Wingfield carried. They started down the steep side of the bluff, following the trail of the wound in the hot light of midafternoon. When they reached the valley floor and began to trudge through the sand in the path the beast had taken, Wingfield spoke for the first time. \"Vince, why do we have to go after it?\"  \"The. thing killed Morse.\" \"But couldn\\'t we just get in the ship and jet off and do the rest of the mapping from the air? That way it couldn\\'t come back to get us. We\\'d be safe.\" Corrigan shook his head doggedly. There was a basic bitterness in his eyes Wingfield had noticed be- fore, deep, as though long-rooted and growir over through the years. T\\'m going on. The thing killed Morse. He was my friend, Joe.\" \"He was mine too,\" Wingfield whined, \"but I want to stay alive. I want to -- \" \"Shut up,\" Corrigan said sharply. His feet sloughed through the sand. Wingfield said something under his breath. T hey walked for two more hours. The sun became unbearably hot and Corrigan felt as though his brain was frying slowly. His eyes hurt and the yellow landscape became shot through with deep flashes of crimson. Wingfield breathed loudly and kept falling behind. The muscles in Corrigan\\'s legs ached, but he kept moving, holding one of the rifles in his right hand. The other was slung across his back. Wingfield dropped his canteen. \"The hills aren\\'t getting any nearer. My canteen\\'s empty.\" Corrigan turned on him angrily. \"You know I didn\\'t bring mine. That water was for both of us.\" \"I can\\'t help it,\" Wingfield said angrily. \"I was thirsty, Vince. I can\\'t help it.\" They staggered on for a few more minutes, finally coming to the top of a sloping rise. They stood there panting heavily. Suddenly Wingfield cried, \"Look, Vince, look!\" The city lay on the desert a half a. mile away. It lay white and sparkling and cool in the sun, white terrace on white terrace, utterly alien and strange in the middle of the burning yellow sand...The buildings towered up and up, their white marble walls covered with cool green vines. Fountains played with flashes of crystal and blue on the terraces. The city stood entirely deserted. \"Look at those fountains!\" Wingfield shouted. \"There\\'s your water for you!\" he began to run. Corrigan followed him, vaguely troubled. There was something about the city that he did not like, something that gave him a strange feeling of evil when he thought about it. But he did not stop running. The water was inviting and he could almost hear its musical splashing as they reached the first of the buildings. The trail of the J)east vanishec at the edge of the city. Corrigan hardly noticed it. The streets through which they walked were shadowed and cool. They moved slowly now, savoring the blue coolness of those shadows, shrinking from the occasional patches of sunlight cutting down between the terraces. The city was refreshing, a dream-like haven in its quietness. \"It\\'s wonderful!\" Wingfield breathed. \"So still and peaceful. I want to find one of those fountains.\" They rounded a corner into an open court. White marble terraces faced a large circular pool of deep blue water with an ornate fountain in its center. Wingfield staggered forward, dropping his pack on the ground, leaving the rifle with it and rushing forward. He fell on his stomach, his mouth close to the pool\\'s edge. Corrigan, a few feet behind him, heard him cry out. T he beast rose frotn the ceri ter of the pool, cleaving thd water cleanly, not making a single ripple in the calm liquid surface Its eyes glared balefully and the black tail twitched. Wingfield stag gered back, grabbing up his rifle as the beast advanced slowly, making snuffling sounds. Suddenly Corrigan knew what was wrong. The city. The city was the Martian ruins at Red Sands, back in the System  He had visited the place as a boy. It was one of thousands of memories in his braiii and the beast had chosen it... fny Gody Corrigan thought, the selectivity and the power... \"There\\'s Tommy!\\' Wingfield touted. Corrigan jammed the rifle butt against his hip but he was powerless to slap the trigger bar. The beast stood at the edge of the pool now, snarling. \"Get back!\" Corrigan\\'s words were a moan. \"I can\\'t shoot!\" Wingfield screamed. \"Tommy\\'s right in front Of him!\" \"Not Tommy,\" Corrigan sobbed. \"Anne! Anne!\" Wingfield\\'s body blocked his view of the beast. Corrigan ran a few steps to the right, shouting Warnings to his Companion. But Wingfield was making motions In the air as if he were struggling with an invisible human being. Corrigan raised the gun again. He girded his will -- strained against it -- trying to fire. He could not. The beast crouched now, slavering -- sure of its power. And around about them, the city began to crumble away. The fountains dried up; the vines and the plants with ered to nothing. Only the beast remained, crouching in the sun, its bonfire eyes shining. Corrigan wept. He was powerless to fire. His arms sagged. Now Anne stood before the beast, her hair the exact corn color that he remembered. She wore the dress she had been wearing on the last day he. had seen her, and she was smilr ing. The smile seemed suddenly insane. She stared at Corrigan and smiled. It\\'s not my wife, Corrigan\\'s mind screamed. It\\'s not my wife standing there holding me powerless If I fire, my slug will not tear the life from her body! No! No! But he knew it would and he could not fire the gun. An image. He thought of each letter of the word separately, thought of them and made pictures of them, big as the tallest buildings of Earth. He thought of dle powers blinking on and off Image. Image. Image. But it did no good. No more good than it would have done Wingfield who was on his knees crooning to his loved ones. The beast grinned hideously, and Corrigan knew it was well aware of its complete power. It crouched there, playing with them and it seemed to say to Corrigan: You know shes false but it does you no good -- that knowledge. My power lies deeper. Your loyalty and love are your weaknesses flow. Its tail lashed and it seemed to be deciding which to kill first. It chose Corrigan, possibly from the instinct he was the stronger of the two, though it apparently made littie difference. It crept toward him, toying with him the while -- playing with him. And Corrigan grinned. He raised his gun and sent five flaming slugs from its muzzle to smash the slavering maw until the great beast-skull was a red stub spouting blood. He lowered the rifle, still grinning without mirth. \"You\\'re a stronger man than I am,\" Wingfield said. He looked as though he had passed through a long and wasting illness. \"No. Weaker, if anything.\" \\'You fired at it twice.\" \"The first time it hadn\\'t concentrated on me.\" \"But the second time it did.\" \"When it showed me Anne, I was helpless.\" \"But -- \" \"It got cocky. It wouldn\\'t let well enough alone,\" \"I don\\'t get it.\" Corrigan did not answer directly. He stared straight ahead through bleak eyes. \"My father was the devil\\'s own nephew. It was bad for me. Worse for my mother. She died very young.\" \"Good God! You mean -- \"I\\'ve often regretted passing up the chances I had to kill my father.\"  After a while they got back to the ship. They climbed in and sailed away with the body of Morse in the ice box. A chat with the editor... Continued from page # All of us here in Kingston are going to make IF better and better as the days go by. We understand full well that thirty-five cents is not easily come by in these times of ever rising costs. So every one of our issues must be the best that can be bought or We wouldn\\'t feel very happy about taking your money. D id it ever occur to you how many different tastes are catered to by the corner newsstand? It was brought home to me rather forcibly by the fact that IP\\'s companion mag is a book of strange and mysterious true stories titled Quinn and has caused me to be thrown into contact with several top name writers. Fine fellows, all, and no mean manipulators on the typewriter, but their field of operation and mine are so utterly alien to each other that we scarcely spoke the same language. The specialized fiction fields include love stories, detective stories, sport yarns, true confessions and true crime, to name but a few. A complete list would fill a directory. However, you and I both know what all those readers are missing. Aren\\'t you glad you\\'re a scienceBy James V. Taurasi Editor Fantasy Times members in the late #s, of\\' ganized fandom is still small Gotn pared with the readership of stf magazines, but # experts on science fiction are a great help to the editors and publishers who want to know what their # more or less readers want. And that is just what fandom is; a core of experts, who make a hobby of reading, collecting and commenting on sciencefiction. Do they render the stf editor any Worthwhile service? You bet they do. Besides telling the editors their wants and dislikes they mirror the likes and dislikes of the readership\\' They also keep a weather eye open for any author who might slip in a plagiarized story; An example of this is the case of an Australian science fiction magazine, where a few authors were copying American stf stories and selling them as their own. A science fiction fan armed fiction magazines showed the Australian editor what was going on and of course the authors were given the gate. In years past, right stf fans that obtained payment for stories fot the authors when the publisher of certain stf magazines was slow in doing so. Also this group, through their amateur publications, keep the editors and publishers informed of what goes on in the field. Many editors and publishers would never know their magazines were being reprinted legally #t Otherwise, outside the United States if it was not for the fan collector. F andom h not organized Under one unit, as many readers are led to believe, because the members of science fiction fandom, just canH agree. They -- like the general readership -- have different ideas df what a story diould be, and theii likes and dislikes differ a great deal. No one group of fandom will give the editor any idea of what to print, but fandom as a whole will give the editor a good idea of what the readers want. And unlike the regular readers, this group will not jUst stop reading the magazine if they are displeased. Fandom will howl plenty and make sure the editors know about it. A wise stf editor will keep himself informed on what fandom thinks of his magazine, and thus know what his readers think. And, let\\'s not forget the advertising angle in connection with stf fandom. Free advertising is given to the professional magazines amounting to thousands of dollars by the activities of stf fandom. Each year, for example, the fans hold a world stf convention. Usually this brings about newspaper, radio, television and magazine reports. Who gains by these reports? The professional magazines of course. Sure, some editors will state that they were the ones who steered the reporters to the conventions to get those writeups. Right they are, but try and get those writeups without the convention! Also most editors are cooperative in aiding the conventions with donations of illustrations, manuscripts and covers. These donations are the main means of paying . off a convention. But the auction of these items gives that professional magazine more publicity than that money could ever obtain. A ctually the cooperation between fandom and the professionals has always been very high and gets stronger every year. Both the fans and the editors realize that neither can get along without the other. Fandom is only there because there are science fiction magazines and books. Without them, fandom would soon die out. This almost happened in Australia when a ban was put on all stf magazines coming ban, plus the birth of an Australian stf magazine, saved fandom there from an untimely death. The same thing would happen in the United States and England if all professional magazines should fold. While on the other hand if all stf fandom should quit, the profession magazines would in a short time lose all their sparkle and pep and become as any other pulp magazine. This zombie-like existence would cause many to lose much of their general readers and thus fold. L ike any other group, fandom has its own quota of crack-pots and drive not only the rest of fandom, but the professional editors to the nearest bar. But fandom has a way to clean its own house and these crackpots either change their tunes or drop out. Fandom also has a way to clean up the professional field when the editor gets out of line and forgets that he is supposed to edit a science fiction magazine. Certain editors have found out what it is to have a large group of fans on their necks. The pressure that fandom can bring about is enormous. With their # plus amateur magazines and thousands of letters, they can make and have made many an editor cry \\'uncle\" and wish he had never gotten off the straight and narrow path of science fiction. All in all, we have a unique situation found in no other field of literature. A situation that will lift our brand of literature to heights never even dreamed about in other fields. A situation where both the editors and readers gain. A situation that could never be applied to any other field. Fandom -- the watch-dog of science fiction. \"You must kill Koski the leader said. \"But ril be dead before I get there\" Buckmaster replied. \"Whafs that got to do with it?\" the leader wanted to know. Infinity\\'s Chiid By Charles V. DeVet T he sense of taste was always first to go. For a week Buckmaster had ignored the fact that everything he ate tasted like flavorless gruel. He tried to make himself believe that it was some minor disorder of his glandular system. But the eighth day his second sense -- that of feeling -- left him and he staggered to his telephone in blind panic. There was no doubt now but that he had the dread Plague. He was glad he had taken the precaution of isolating himself from his family. He knew there was no hope for him now. They sent the black wagon for him. In the hospital he found himself herded with several hundred others into a ward designed to hold less than a hundred. The beds were crowded together and he could have reached to either side of him and touched another ravaged victim of the Plague. Next to go would be his sense of sight. Hope was a dead thing within him. Even to think of hoping made him realize how futile it would be. He screamed when the walls of darkness began to close in around him. It was the middle of the afternoon and a shaft of sunlight fell across the grimy blankets on his bed. The sunlight paled, then darkened , and wasgone. He screamed again. And again. He heard them move him to the death ward then, but he could not even feel their hands upon him. Three days later his tongue refused to form words. He fought a nameless terror as he strove with all the power of his will to speak. If he could say only one word, he felt, the encroaching disease would have to retreat and he would be safe. But the one word would not come. Four horrible days later the sounds around him -- the screams and the muttering -- iDecame fainter, and he faced the beginning of the end. At last it was all over. He knew he was still alive because he thought. But that was all. He could not see, hear, speak, feel, or taste. Nothing was left except thought; stark, terrible, useless thought! Strangely the awful horror faded then and his mind experieticea a grateful release. At first he sus pected the outlgt of his emotions had somehow become atrophied as had his senses, and that he was peaceful only because his real feelings could not break through the lumbness. However, some subtle compulsion within him -- some power struggling in its birththroes -- was beginning to breed its own energy and he send that it was the strength of that compulsion that had subdued the terror. He was at peace now, as he had never been at peace before. For a time, he did not question -- was entirely content to lie there and savor the wonderful feeling. He had lost even the definition of fear. No terror now from the slow closing of the five doors; no regrets; no forebodings. Only a vast happiness as he seemingly viewed life, suffering, and death as a man standing on a cliff looking out over a grefit misty valley. But soon came bonder and analysis. He looked backward and thought: It was a worlds but not my world. These are memories but not my memories. I lived them arid knew themyet none of them belongs to me. Strangethis soulfiber with which I think -- the last function left to tne -- is not a soutftber I have ever knoWfi beforei And he knew. I have never existed before this moment. He could not prove it nor explain it there in the dark house of his thinking. But he knew it was true. He wondered if he had taken over the body and mind -- complete with all the mental trappings -- of some other being. Or whether he had been just now conceived, fullblown and with memories of a synthetic past perhaps implanted also in the minds of those with whom he was supposed to have come in contact. He did not know. He was only sure that, before this moment, he had not been. W TH the realization came the certainty that he would not die. The force he felt within him -- he was not certain whether it was a part of himself, or the evidence of an outside control -- was too powerful. The inner spontaneity gathered strength until it became a striving, persistent vital force, a will of imperious purpose. It moved him and he moved his tongue and spoke. \"I will not die!\" he shouted. Some time later he grew aware that his sense of hearing had returned. He heard a voice say, \"He was in the last stages about an hour ago, before he spoke. I thought I\\'d better call you.\" \"You did right,\" a second voice answered. \"What\\'s his name?\" \"Clifford Buckmaster.\" They\\'re talking about me, he thought. Like a burst of glory, sight returned. He looked up and saw two men standing beside his bed. The olde man wore a plain black suit. The younger was dressed in the white uniform of a doctor. \"He can see now,\" the older man said. His was a voice Buckmaster disliked. \"It looks as if he\\'s going to recover,\" the doctor said. \"That\\'s never happened before. Do you want me to leave him here with the dying ones?\" \"No. wheel him into your office. And leave us alone there. My name is James Wagner. You have, of course, heard of me. I am the Director of Security.\" Buckmaster still rested in his hospital bed. They had screwed up the back until he sat almost straight. In his mouth there was a slight tang and knew the sense of taste returned, When he was able to feel again he would be entirely well. Yes, he\\'d heard of Wagner before. He nodded. \"And I know who you are,\" Wagner said. \"You are one of the Underground that is trying to overthrow the General. That is correct, is it not?\" Almost with surprise Buckmaster felt Wagner\\'s words register in his mind. His implanted memories were still strange to him. But he recalled them quickly. Twenty years before, in #, the great Atomic War had ended. In the beginning the two giants faced each other across the separating oceans. No one was certain who sent the first bomb across in its controlled rocket; each side blamed the other. The methods of each were terrible in their efficiency. The great manufacturing cities were the first to go. After them went the vital transportation centers. Striving mightily for an early advantage each country forced landing armies on the enemy\\'s shores. The armies invaded with their hundreds of thousands of men -- and the bombings continued. The colossus of the western hemisphere had set up autonomous launching stations so that if and when their major cities had all been bombed their ruling bodies decimated and scatteredeven if there were no longer any vestiges of a central authority -- the launchings would continue. The autonomous units had been a stroke of master plannings so ingenious that it was logical the giant of Eurasia had devised a similar plan B y the time the bombs had all been used, or their stations rendered incapable of functioning, the major cities were blackened, gutted, inoperative masses of destruction. Soon the invading armies no longer received orders, or supE lies of rations and arms. When this appened they knew governments they represented had ceased to exist. They were forced to live by the ingenuity of their commanders and their ability to forage. They could not evdn capitulate ; there was no one to whom they could surrender. i Those armies with weak commanders fell apart and one by one their men died at the hands of hostile natives, or hunger. The armies under  strong commanders, like General Andrei Koski, of the Eurasian command, carved themselves a place in their new environment. Koski had landed with a force of seventy thousand on the east coast of old Mexico. His army was different from the other invaders only in a secret weapon which they brought wiffr them The weapon\\'s appearance was simple but it carried the potentiality of destruction for a world. Acting under previous orders from his government, Koski began moving northward, and was soon cutting a swath a hundred miles wide up the west bank of the Mississippi. By the time he reached the southern border of Minnesota he realized from what he saw on all sides, that for all practical purposes the war was over. His only choice now was to find a means of. survival for himself and his men. When Koski reached Duluth he circled the city. Almost miracu lously it had escaped the bombs. Its population was only a little over two hundred thousand, and Koski still retained nearly fifty thousand hardened fighting men. However, Duluth, KoSki found, wasgoverned by Earl Olson, an ex brigadier and a man equally as strong as himself. The city was fortified, and garrisoned by a force of well trained civilians who would fight to their death to defend their city and families. And they were well ledby Olson. Koski knew he could capture the city if he decided to, but the price Would be too dear. He moved on along the lakeshore and took over the city of Superior. Here he entrenched himself solidly and set up an efficient military government. By law every woman in the city still capable of bearing children was forced to take two husbands, at least one of which must be a Ruskie, as the invaders were called by the natives. In this way Koski insured a plentiful supply of children, most of whom would be loyal to him. A bonus of ten thousand dollars was offered to any woman from the outlying districts who would move to Superior and take two of its citizens in marriage. After the first hesitation, the girls and yoting women and widows flocked in from their barren farms and hamlets. By the end of twenty years the city had grown to near one hundred fifty thousand. Duluth in the meantime grew to three hundred thousand. Earl Olson ruled absolutely, but wisely and well. Between the two cities an alert truce held through the years and mutually advantageous trade flourished. Koski, in his city, held all authority in his own tight grip, administered by his former officers and backed by the undeviating loyalty of his soldiers. His rule was stern and when necessary, bloody. It might have been bloodier except for the threat of intervention by Olsohi T here are always men who fret under the hand of tyranny and the Underground had gradually risen until it grew into a powerful organization. Its demands were for a representative government chosen by vote of the people. This, of course, Koski refused. As a consequence the Underground formed an active resistance, with the retaliatory blood bath was prevented only by the threat of intervention by Olson, who had many friends in the Underground, especially his brother-in-law, Lestef Oliver. But right\\'d now liofie of this seemed very important to Buckmaster. Not important enough for hirtt to bother answering, \"Answer when you\\'re spoken to!\" Wagner roared. For a moment Buckmaster deliberated riot replying. Just how unusual was the difference he had discovered in himself? Could he be hurt by someone like Wagner? He decided to wait until later to put it to the test. \"What do you want me to say?\" he asked. \"I\\'m going to lay my cards on the table,\" Wagner said. \"I want you to come over to our side.\" Still not very interested. Buckmaster asked, \"Why should I?\" \\' \"I think I can give you some very good reasons. In fact, unless you\\'re a bigger fool than I think you are, I can convince you that it is the only wise thing to do. Because of your relatively smaller numbers, the Plague has caused havoc in your Underground.\" \"Yes,\" Buckmaster answered. \"But We will have a vaccine before long.\" He knew this was purely bluff. \"Possibly.\" Wagner pulled his cheeks up but his eyes remained chilled and cold. He had the trick of smiling mirthlessly. \"But even if I were to grant you that, we estimate that already nearly half of your organization is dead from the Plague. There will be more before you can do anything. The rest we can hunt down at our leisure. So you see, even if we let you live. you\\'d soon be a man without a party\\' \"We could start all over again if we had to,\" The first signs of feeling came back with a twinge of pain at the tip of the little finger on his left hand. \"I doubt it very much.\" \"What would I be expected to do?\" Buckmaster asked. \"Simply this. Go back among your former comrades and act normal. But let me know what they\\'re planning. In time we\\'d get them anyway, but with your help, the job will be easier -- cleaner, let us say.\" \"In other words, you want me to act as the Judas ram?\" \"Call it what you like,\" Wagner\\'s eyes narrowed. \"Just remember that you\\'ve nothing to lose.\" \"And after?\" \"You can name your own price. Within reason, of course.\" \"And if I refuse?\" wasn\\'t necessary for him to answer. Buckmaster had seen the results of Wagner\\'s sadism in the past. Whatever else might be mystifying to him he knew one thing: The instinct of self-preservation was still as strong as ever. He did not want to take the chance that the extraneous will he felt within him would be strong enough to combat what Wagner would try to do to him. \"Let\\'s say I agree,\" he said. \"What comes next?\" \"Can you move your limbs yet?\" Wagner asked. Buckmaster flexed his fingers and lifted his amis. \"I believe I\\'m strong enough to walk,\" he said. \"By the way,\" Wagner inquired, \"have you any idea why you didn\\'t die?\" Buckmaster shook his head. \"Well, no matter. Lie back and relax. Now look into my eyes. Concentrate on the right one.\" Buckmaster knew what was coming now. Mind contact! Subtly he felt the first tentative probe of Wagner\\'s thought antenna. One part of his brain accepted it passively, but another part used the probe as a bridge. Wagner\\'s thoughts seemed unguarded. Buckmaster easily read everything there. He had to hide his surprise at what he learned. Things that Wagner, by no process of logic would ever reveal to him. Reflections concerning the Plague. Remembrances of snatches of conversation with the General. Wagner\\'s relations with women. Sex occupied many of his thoughts. The fear of Olson was there, in spite of Wagner\\'s brave words earlier. Then Buckmaster read about himself in Wagner\\'s mind and was certain something was wrong here. He saw that Wagner had no intention of ever letting him live, no matter how useful he might be. There was death for himself as soon as that usefulness was over. \"Damn it,\" Wagner cursed, \"relax. Let your mind open up to me. Are you deliberately trying to get yourself back in trouble by being stubborn?\" Then he knew. The contact had been one-way. He had read Wagner\\'s mind because Wagner had not realized he could do it, and had not thrown up a guard. Cautiously Buckmaster let fragments of careful thoughts escape. The moment he lowered the barriers of his mind he felt Wagner\\'s power beat against him, wave upon wave. The sensation was frightening. Wagner seemed satisfied. Buckmaster could read very little in his mind now. \"Done,\" Wagner said. \"Now, one last warning. Don\\'t try to double-cross me, or you\\'ll regret the day you were born.\" Buckmaster\\'s choices of action were very few. He doubted that he could make it but at least he should try to get to Duluth. At the toll bridge across the arm of the lake he bought a ticket. Nobody bothered him. He breathed easier as he rested against the iron railing waiting for the gate to open ; then stopped breathing as a tall man -- one of the Ruskies -- leaned over beside him and said, \"It won\\'t Work, friend.\"  Buckmaster tore up his ticket. Strangely, there was a sense of relief. The force -- the presence within him -- whatever it was, wanted him to return to his friends. It didn\\'t compel him, it used no coercion. It merely presented good reasons for doing so. He could do more good there than by fleeing, it suggested. And, so strongly as almost to blot opt all other emotions, was the implanted desire -- an urgent, compelling command -- to stay and kill Koski. As Buckmaster started back, the thought struck him: Was he merely a pawn being moved by this inner power? Did he no longer have freedom of action? Was his will still his own? receive the summons from Koski. He fumed inwardly as he mounted the stairs to the General\\'s second floor receiving room. It was always humiliating to be summoned like a common officer when he was in fact the ruler of the city. Koski had slipped bdly during the past few years but Wagner knew better than to put the old figurehead out of the way. He needed the power of that prestige until he had made his own position impregnable. Originally Wagner had been an unlettered lad from the steppes. When he had been made Koii\\'s orderly, he had used his native cunning and slyness to ingratiate himself with the old commander. Soon Koski had made him his personal adjutant. From that advantageous position of trust it had been relatively simple for him to use his insidious talents to secure advantages for himself. During the process of organizing Superior\\'s government Wagner had used his influence to get his own adherents appointed to key posts. By the time Koski began to succumb to the ravages of senility, Wagner held the most powerful position in the city -- that of Security Administratoti By now Koski was so far gone that he did not even realize he did not rule; that the city\\'s functions had come under the control, direct and indirect, of Wagner. \"You wanted to see me. Sir?\" Wagner asked. \"Yes,\" the General answered, the shaggy hairs of his eyebrows meeting in a frown. \"Have the doctors found a remedy for the Plague yet? It has gone so far now that soon the manpower we must have for the Campaign will be threatened.\" \"Not yet, Sir, but they are within sight of it.\" Wagner was always careful to keep the scorn he felt from his voice. The old dodderer was useful and must be pampered -- for awhile. The General still clung to his dream of the Campaign. His ultimate plan, from the time he had taken over Superior, had been to use the city as a base from which to spread his rule, until he had control of the entire continent -- in the name of the mother country, of course. He had never let himself see that it was but a dream. He was certain that he would find other pockets of his fellow-men who, like himself had set up autonomous governments. With their aid he stilk hoped for an ultimate victory over the enemy. This would always remain enemy territory to him. \"If we don\\'t stop the Plague before it spreads to our own men, I\\'U be forced to use the Weapon,\" Koski growled. His great bony features had lost all powder of expression except their habitual scowl, but his voice was still deep and vibrant. \"I\\'ll kill every man, woman, and child in the country!\" Wagner had to admire the will to destruction that still rode the old man. He may have weakened in his mind but he had nver softened. And the Weapon? It was the one secret that Wagner had not been able to learn. \"Yes, Sir,\" Wagner agreed. \"If you should ever feel the need to use the Weapon, I ask you to remember that my only wish is to be of aid to my General.\" Koski\\'s washed blue eyes grew crafty. \"I fully realize that. But I will need no help. You may accept my compliments and withdraw.\" W agner muttered a soft oath under his breath as he bowed humbly. jtx, die,\" Buckmaster said. The two chairs in the small room were occupied by the men he faced. He sat on a steel-framed bed. \"No,\" Lester Oliver was thoughtful. \"I\\'m wondering why you didn\\'t. Do you have any explanation?\" \"Only something that you wouldn\\'t understand, unless it happened to you,\" Buckmaster answered. \"I couldn\\'t explain it.\" \"Try.\" Oliver spoke softly, but Buckmaster knew that behind that softness Oliver hid a bulldog tenacity. Carefully, patiently Buckmaster told about the Force, trying to make them sense it as he had. \"You feel then,\" Cecil Cuff, the other man in the room, said, \"that you\\'re in the grip of something over which you have no direct control?\" \"Yes?\\' \"Are you certain that it is not the contact Wagner imposed on you?\" \"It came before Wagner was present,\" Buckmaster replied. Cuff turned to Oliver. \"I know he believes what he is saying,\" he said. \"But it\\'s obvious that his mind has been tampered with. If we let him live, we\\'ll be taking the risk that the General and Wagner are getting at us, through him.\" \"That\\'s right,\" Oliver answered. \"I think he should be killed,\" Guff said. Oliver was thoughtful for a l#ng moment. \"What do you think, Clifford?\" he asked gently. He always called Buckmaster by his first name. Buckmaster breathed deeply. \"Naturally I want to live,\" he answered. \"But from the viewpoint of the Underground I suppose Cuff is right.\" \"You say that you feel that this Force is a protective one,\" Oliver said. \"Does it seem to you that perhaps we couldn\\'t kill you -- that it would prevent us?\" Buckmaster searched for words to express his thoughts. \"I feel,\" he said, \"that it won\\'t let me be killed. It seems that I have a mission to fulfill, and that it won\\'t let me die -- at least not until I accomplish what it desires. However, I feel also that it will, or can, do nothing concrete to prevent my being killed. It will probably aid me by convincing you that it would be better to let me live.\" \"Do you feel that its purpose might be much the same as ours, and that it will attempt to convince us of that?\" Oliver asked. \"Something like that,\" Buckmaster answered. \"At least the urge to kill Koski is so strong within me that I know I would not hesitate if I had the chance, even if it meant my own life\\' \"Would you attempt to stop us if we tried to kill you?\" \"No.\" Oliver closed his eyes. He was silent for so long that it seemed he must be sleeping. But Buckmaster knew that Oliver\\'s brain worked with lightning speed while his body reposed. Oliver was the most intelligent man he had ever known. He was head of the Underground solely because he was the fittest man for the job. F inally Oliver spoke. \"We\\'ll come back to it later,\" he said. \"Did you learn anything that might help us, Clifford?\" \"I learned that the Plague is spread by contact -- only after the first symptoms show themselves. I read that in Wagner\\'s mind before he realized that I was reading hl thoughts.\" \"That will help. You say you made contact before you became en rapport with Wagner. Gan you control what you let him learn through you?\" \"I believe I ean, but I cant be certain.\" \"If yOu could be certain, we wouldn\\'t have to kill you,\" Oliver said. \"You would be taking a chance,\" Buckmaster replied. \"We can\\'t afford to take any chances,\" Guff said. \"He -- \" \"Yx)u\\'re forgetting one thing, Cecil,\" Oliver interrupted. \"As things stand right now, we\\'re a lost cause. The Plague has killed many of our best men. The only thing that keeps Koski from staging a blood-bath is his fear of Governor Olson in Duluth. And pretty soon he won\\'t have to fear that. We have only to lose another key dozen and Olson will have no friends here to aid.\" \"May I offer a compromise?\" Buckmaster asked. \"As matters stand now, our only chance of winning freedom from Koski\\'s savage rule is to kill him. And to do that we will have to kill Wagner first. Am I correct?\" \"Yes.\" Oliver raised his head. \"What do you have to suggest?\" \"Let me try to kill Wagner. If I succeed our cause will have taken a big step. If he kills me first, then you\\'ve lost nothing more than if you\\'d killed me yourselves.\" After a barely perceptible hesitation Oliver nodded in agreement. For the rest of the day Buckmas-. ter improvised a simulated course of action to let seep through to Wagner whenever he felt a probe. He kept his mind blank otherwise and was quite certain that he carried on the deception well. He caught nothing from Wagner in return that was not deliberately let through. He suspected that his own control was as good. Though he had not had the practice at this that Wagner had. Toward evening he improvised a crisis. The Underground was plotting something big, he transmitted. He made the need for action imperative and asked for a personal interview. At first Wagner demurred. He wanted Buckmaster to stay on and give first hand reports. Buckmaster gave hints in return that he was suspected by the other members, and indicated that he must leave while still able to. Finally Wagner agreed. \\' \"You realize the risk you\\'re taking, coming with me, Cecil?\" Buckmaster asked. \"I do,\" Cuff said with his unchangeable reserve. \"But you\\'ll need my help.\" Buckmaster wished he himself could remain as cool. His own nerves felt like wires that had been drawn too tightly. Cuff was tall and robust, with a pessimistic outlook on life... He seemed to sit back and watch life and its peoples as a spectator, willing to fight ruthlessly for what he believed was right, but never expecting to discover anything fine enough in his fellow men to hope for anything better from them. He had touched the borders of an existence that was mean and hard and dirty and he had long ago despaired of finding anything else. Yet there was nothing apathetic about his personality. Life\\'s illusions were gone, but its fascination remained. too much,\" Buckmaster said. Cuff acknowledged the statement by nodding his head. \"I believed that you might be under Wagner\\'s power. Wagner is a brute trying to break us. On this trip you\\'re going to make your own heaven or hell, and if you\\'ve got the courage to face it, I\\'ll back you up.\" In the Administration Building the girl at the information desk told them, \"The Director will see you in a moment.\" She led them into a waiting room. Three hard-faced men, all wearing black shirts, came in. They had the mark of killers about them. \"Stand up.\" They checked fiuckmaster and Guff forweapons. None was found. All five toak the elevator to the sixth floor. Wagner was seated at his desk waiting for them when they walked into his office. He smiled his mirthless smile. \"I see you brought com pany\\' he said. \"We\\'ll get two birds with one stone.\" Buckmaster knew then that there was little use trying any further deception. Wagner knew. If he were able to squeeze through just a short ten seconds the job could still be done. The three bodyguards stood a few yards behind them. \"I have something here that will interest you\\' Buckmaster said. Slowly, Unhurriedly, but wasting no motion, he unbuttoned one flap on his shirt and reached a hand inside. He peeled back the long strip of adhesive tape covering the cavity below his ribs. He pulled out the small single-shot derringer con cealed there. Jle aimed from the waist and put the bullet into the middle of Wagner\\'s smile. The smile cracked, and the crack became a shatter spreading in all directions. Buckmaster saw the trap then. He had shot at a reflection of Wagner. It had been a cleverly arranged mirror deception. Cuff turned to run through the door they had entered. But Buckmaster was so certain any attempt to escape would be in vain that he did not even move. Guff found the three guards blocking the doorway Buckmaster watched Wagner enter from opposite the cracked rnir ror. There were two more of his bodyguards with him. When the guards closed in Guff struggled until they spun him back against the wall where his head crashed with a dull crunch All the fight went out of him and he slumped in the arms of the men who held him. T wd of the guards held Buckmaster\\'s arms. \"A couple of fine birds,\\' Wagner said as he stood in front of them. Guff straightened with an effort of will and shook his head until his vision cleared He leveled his glancd at Wagner. \"You\\'re a mongrel cur,\" he said unemotionally;, \"licking at the General\\'s boots. He\\'ll throw you another Scrap for this day\\'s work.\" Both he and Buckmaster knew that he sealed his dWn fate with the words. The one thing Wagner could not tolerate Was ridicule, worse in the presence of his own men. Buckmaster caught the hard flat explosion in his face and pain in his eardrums as the gun that ap peared in Wagner\\'s hand went off. As he watched Guff slump he knew the man was beyond torture. He suspected that this was what Guff had wanted. He had taken the easy way out. Buckmaster leaned his shoulders back and then with sudden violence pulled his arms free from the guards\\' grip. He slapped Wagner across the mouth with his left hand and brought his right fist around in a short arc that crushed the bone in Wagner\\'s nose. He made no resistance as the guards grabbed him and twisted his arm cruelly behind his back. The hurt from Wagner\\'s shattered nose brought a bright glisten of pain into his eyes. \"That was a mistake\\' Wagner said, the depth of his anger making his voice soft and husky, \"Fm going to make you whine like a dog.\" T he general was suffering the tragedy of a strong man whose mind was turning senile -- and who realized it. Only the two alternative objectives remained virile ; the Campaign and, that failing, the Weapon. The Weapon gave him his only solace in times of trouble. Now, going down into the basement of his house, he sought it out again. Letting himself through two thick concrete doors, which he opened with a key that he wore about his neck at all times, he entered the room that held his potentially terrible secret. The outer contour of the Weapon was a rectangular frame of rough lumber. Inside was a metal box, and in this reposed a semiglutinous mass of liquid. Nothing more. On the shelf above rested a bottle of aqua fortis. Quite simple substances -- apart. Together they could spell the destruction of a world. The Dictator himself, had given Koski his instructions long before, back in the homeland. \"General,\" you are being sent with an army, but its purpose is to protect your Weapon, and to bring it into a position of maximum effectiveness, rather than to fight. You fully understand, I hope, that if you ever have to use it, your mission will certainly be fatal to yourself?\" \"I understand, Sire,\" Koski answered. \\'T am thankful for the honor you have done me.\" \"Your mission is to carry the Weapon to a central location on the North American continent. I believe you have the force necessary to accomplish that.\" Koski nodded but said nothing. \"The component ingredients of the Weapon I know no better than you yourself. It was developed at the Institute. Its special faculty is its ability to free hydrogen from the moisture in the air, and to start a chain reaction. The physicists tell me that it will sear most of the continent once it starts reacting. About the only spot that would be spared are the dry regions, and maybe not even those. Just one thing you must remember -- do not use it unless you are certain that the war is definitely lost. Do you understand the importance of that command?\" \"I do,\" Koski answered. \"But wouldn\\'t it be better to use it as soon as possible? The lives of my men and myself would be a small price to pay for victory.\" \"True, except for one big question,\" the Dictator replied. \"The explosive is so deadly that it was impossible to experiment. There is no such thing as a little bit of it. Consequently we are not certain of its effects. We expect, and hope, that it will dissipate itself as it spreads too far from its initial explosion point, but we cannot be certain. It is possible that, once released, it will devastate the entire world. You see now why it must be used only as a last resort?\" Many times since Koski had gone over that conversation in his mind. Had the war been lost? Neither side had come through with functioning governments. Therefore, what course should he take? Pef- haps the invaders even now ruled the homeland. Would he gain, or would he lose the last cha;ice for ultimate victory by setting off the explosive? During the rare moments when his mind Cleared, Koski realized the small chance the Campaign would have. At such times the Weapon beckoned. He knew then that the Campaign would never be completed in his lifetime. Wagner, however, was a very good man, with all the ideals of his country He would carry on. It needed only a slight variation in the trend of events, to tip that scale one way or the other. Even now the General held the bottle of aqua fords in his hand -- undecided. The fate of the world teetered. \"You aren\\'t so pretty anymore,\\' Wagner said. \"Neither are you,\" Buckmaster answered through battered, bloody lips. He Wondered where he found the strength to keep taunting Wagner. He could feel that his face was a lumpy mess. One eye was closed and blood, running down into the other, kept blinding him. Every muscle in his body ached from the pounding it had taken, and he sus pected that his left arm was broken. He sagged in his bonds. Wagner, he knew, was deliberately gauging the punishment. He meant to torture him to the verge of death, but he did not intend to let him die without further torment. Buckmaster wondered how much more he could stand. Long ago he had despaired of any help from the Force. He had felt nothing since the torture started. It was evident that it couldn\\'t do anything, or would not, to stop this orgy of sadism. And he knew that any subtle attempts to divert Wagner from his sadistic pleasure would be useless. Wagner had ail the instruments required for refined torture here. It was evident that he had used them many times in the past. He strapped Buckmaster\\'s wrists to a waist-high wooden rack. \"You\\'ll be pleased to know that I have made a thorough study of the human anatomy,\" Wagner said. \"Therefore, when I begin cutting off your limbs, one joint at a time, you won\\'t have to worry. I\\'ll see that you do not die -- and also that you retain consciousness. I wouldn\\'t want you to miss the exquisite deli cacy with which I perform the operations. You\\'ll be a basket case when I get through.\" Wagner picked up a short scalpel with an edge honed to a fine, razor sharpness. \"This is a delicate little experiment that I find very effective,\" he said. He lifted Buckmaster\\'s right index finger and cut deeply through the flesh\\' of its tip. The intense acuteness of the sensitive nerves made the agony unbearable. Wave after wave of shock sensations struck at his nerve fibers as the blade traced a raw red path through another finger-tip. Sickness gathered in his stomach and retched up into his throat to gag him. He sucked in great gulps of air until at last he could stand no more pain and welcome oblivion blanked him out. He returned to consciousness to no find Vagner still there -- waiting. \"Tsk, tsk\\' Wagner chided. \"So you\\'re not so tough, after all? And just when it was getting interestThis time Buckmaster did not have the strength to defy him. He was beaten. He prayed that Wagner would tire of his pleasure before he had to stand any more. He wanted to go out still a man, and not a broken hulk, tearful, pleading, begging for mercy. \"I think you\\'re ready for something a bit more subtle,\" Wagner said. He concentrated his gaze on Buckmaster\\'s eyes and slowly, cruelly built up a mental strain. The mind contact still held. Buckmaster realized that Wagner had been keeping this until he .was too mentally whipped to fight back. He was surprised then to feel that he fought off the pressure with little strain to himself. Still lurking there in his mind, was the Force, quiet, hardly felt, bdt virile, with a sense of dynamic quiescence potency! Hope came where all hope had been dead. Something within him throbbed like electricity, and he sent a bolt of mental energy at Wagner\\'s head. The shock of the emotional concussion brought blood bursting from Wagner\\'s nostrils and eye sockets. A red tide poured from his lips. His head dropped loosely and Buckmaster knew that Wagner was dead even before he fell from his chair. Buckmaster sat astounded at the demonstration of power. He sat for a moment listening to the. inner voice that sent up its answers to his silent questions. No, it hadn\\'t been able to help him before. Its power was not physical. No, it could not help him escape. From here he was on his own. The only satisfaction he received was the closer entity he had found between himself and the Force. It seemed to him now that it did not come from the outside. Rather it was an essential part of himself. Or, more exactly, he was a part of that Force. Buckmaster worked his wrists backwards in their thongs until he forced the leather straps over the bases of his hands. Thus he was able to bend his wrists. Slowly, painfully, he brought up his right leg until his foot rested next to his right hand. The left foot next. Once he almost lost his balance. But at last he stood with his feet straddling his hands. He exerted all the strength of his leg, arm, and trunk muscles. The pain from his broken arm was a sickening thing but slowly the leather bands began to tear loose from the rivets that held them. A last mighty e;xertion and he was free. Wagner had a private elevator. Buckmaster entered and went to a ground floor. He walked out of the building through a tradesmen\\'s entrance into a dusky alley. Keeping his good arm in front of his face he staggered around the corner and into a drugstore and reached a phone booth without being observed. He put in a call and crouched in the phone booth for the ten long minutes it took Oliver to come for him. \"Two weeks aren\\'t very long to get you well, Clifford,\" Oliver said, \"but I\\'m afraid it\\'s all the time we have I\\'m softy\"\\' \"You did yout best\\' Buckmaster answered \"At least you\\'ve got m# pfetty well patched up.\" \"The last reports Wete that the police have drawn a ring around this district and that they\\'re closing in.\" \"Do We have any Way out?\" \"I hate to have to say this Oliver said slowly. \"But the rest of Us can get out -- if we don\\'t take you with us.\" B uckmaster had expected this. It seemed that he had known from the beginning that he Would never live to see the end of this adventure. \"It\\'s all right. Is there anything I can do to help \"No. They won\\'t stop us if you aren\\'t along You\\'re the man they\\'re after. If there were any way I could help you by staying, I\\'d never leave. But I\\'d only be captured with you, and nothing gained.\" \"Of course I understand.\" Buckmaster rested his hand for a mo ment on the old leader\\'s shoulder. \"Don\\'t feel badly about it Lester. The men need you. You owe it to them to get out if you can.\" Oliver gripped his hand. \"Before I go I want you to know how grate ful we are for the help you\\'ve given us. Without Wagner the General won\\'t be nearly as hard to handle And one other thing: I don\\'t want you to hope too much, but there! still a chance we may be able to get you out. I\\'m trying a long shot. So if someone comes for you, go with himi In the meantime, keep your chin Up.\\' They shook hands again. Buck\" master surmised that Oliver was trying to give him something to cling to while he waited for the end. Then he was alone. Three hours later Buckmaster spotted the first of his executioners f One of the Ruskies that walked with studied unconcern across the street Almost at the same time he heard a rap on the rear door of the apartment. He drew the gun Oliver had left with him and walked slowly to the door. \"Who is it?\" \"Oliver sent me for you,\" the voice on the other side of the door answered. \"Gome in with your hands up.\" Buckmaster flattened himself against a side wall and shoved hi! gun into the ribs of a tail young man. \"Who are you?\" \"My name is August Gamoll\\' the man said. Somehow the name Was familiar. He diould recognize it, Buckmaster thought. Abruptly he did. \"What are you trying to do?\" Buckmaster asked harshly. \"Maket a small-time hero of yourself with this grandstand play?\" \"Not at all,\" Gamoll answered \"I\\'m the long shot Oliver mentioned.\" \"You\\'re lying.\" \\' , \"Then how would I know what Oliver said?\" \"It may be a lucky guess. Why should I trust you?\" \"Mainly because you have no choice. What have you got to lose?\" He was a cool character. Buckmaster shrugged. He hated this playing it blind, but the fellow was right. he said. \"You might as well take your hands down. Let\\'s go.\" They went down the stairs. At the rear exit Gamoll looked out. He wore no hat. The wind from the alley fluffed the hair on the side of his head. \"All clear \" Gamoll said. \"Make a dash for it. When you get in tiie carriage lie low. Now!\" The die was cast, Buckmaster decided. He\\'d play It to the hilt now, all or nothing. He sprinted across the dirt of the alley and jerked open a door of the carriage. He threw himself inside and hugged the floor. Soon the carriage began to roll. When they had travelled about a half block it stopped. Buckpi aster drew in his breath. This was the critical point. If Gamoll could bluff his way through now the rest would be comparatively easy. \"Give me an escort, Captain,\" he heard Gamoll say. \"I don\\'t want to get tied up here. I understand there\\'s gQing to be some shooting soon.\" \"That\\'s right, sir,\" a crisp military voice answered. \"It\\'s best that you get out fast. I\\'ll send one of my men with you.\" The carriage started forward again. A half-hour later it stopped once more. \"You may get up now,\" Gamoll said. \"We\\'re going inside. Stay close to me.\" prised when he alighted and found himself near a side door to the General\\'s private residence, \"I don\\'t get all this,\"Buckmaster said. \"You\\'ve had me here for six days now, and I\\'ve only seen you twice. Why should the General\\'s son be hiding me?\" \"Quite simple. I don\\'t like his methods, or his government, any more than you do. Oliver knew that when he sent his message to me asking for help.\" \"Do you mean to say that you\\'d help us kill your own father?\" \"As to that,\" Gamoll said, \"if you\\'ll notice, my hair and eyes are brown. \"So?\" \"Koski\\'s eyes and my mother\\'s are blue. You probably know that it is genetically impossible for twoblue-eyed people to have a browneyed son.\" \"Then you\\'re not his son?\" Buckmaster was silent for a minute. \"That\\'s why you took the name of your mother\\'s other husband,\" he mused. \"If you remember, when the law was passed that each woman must have two husbands, the General set the example by marryipg a woman who already had a husband. He knows that I am not his son biologically, but I am legally, and I have full inheritance rights. He was too smart -- as well as legally exact -- to disown me.\" \"That means you\\'d automatically become the government head if the General died?\" \"Yes. But you\\'re wrong if you think that I am doing this from any selfish motive. If I succeed, I\\'ll institute a democratic form of government at my first opportunity.\" \"I\\'ll wait until I see it\" Buckmaster answered cynically. \"But if It\\'s true are your ideals strong enough to help us kill him?\" For the first time Gamoll seemed uncertain of hirnself. \"Why is it necessary to kill him, especially now that Wagner is dead? We both know that Wagner did the actual ruling. And the General is an old man, without much longer to live. We\\'ll win if we do no more than stand by.\" \"He must dieand soon!\" Buck- master exclaimed\" surprised at the vehemence of the words. So vital had been the command, that he knew what he had said was true: Koski must die, in the very near future. Though he himself was not certain of the need for such urgency. \"I suppose I understand Gamoll said, a trifle uneasily. \"You have to act in self-defense! If you don\\'t kill him, he will probably be able to kill many more of your men before he dies. But try to see his side. He is the representative of a Cause that is just -- to his way of reasoning; so right and so just that he will do anything to advance it. Whatever we may think of him, hii conscience Is clear. I ofily ask you this! If you can See yoUT way clear to attain your ends without For another nine days Buckmaster stayed with Gamoll. He had nothing to occupy his time. In idle curiosity he went through the books in Gamoll\\'s library. The young man owned many good booki Before long Buckmaster\\'s idle brOwng turned to an intent search. For the first time he began finding clues to the mystery that rode with in him. His first clue, he thought, was a passage he read in a physics book entitled, \"The Limitations of Sci ence,\" by Sullivan: Research has changed our whole conception of matter The first step was the perimental demonstration that there exist little electrified bodies, very much smaller than a hydrbgeri atom, called electrons Measurement was made with the result that the whoie mass of the electron was found to be due to its electric charge This was the first indication that the material universe is not the substantial, objective thing we had always taken it to be Mat ter began to thin away into the completely spectral thing it has now become. The notion of substance had to he replaced by the notion of behavior He passed readily from physics to the more fertile field of philosophy with the groping statement of Voltaire: I have seen that which is called matter both as the star Sirius, and as the smallest atom which can be perceived with the microscope; and I do not know What this matter is. He pursued this quest readily with the philosopher Schopenhauer and passed almost \\' imperceptibly into metaphysics: I will never believe that even the simplest chemical combination wilt ever admit of mechanical explanation; much less the properties of light, heat, and electricity. These will always require a dynamical explanation. If we can ferret out the ultimate nature of our own fninds we shall perhaps have the key to the exief nd world. Let us say, then, that repulsion and attraction, combination and decomposition, magnetism and electricity, gravity and crystalliza tion, are Will. Will, then, is the essence of man. Now what if it is also the essence of life in all its forms, and even of Hnanimate matter? What if Will is the longsought\\'for, the longdespaired-of , Hhe thing-in-itself  -- the ultimate inner reality and se cret essence of all things? Buckmaster perceived that these men were catching glimpses of something which they called Will, Order, Thing, Absolute, and other names but which were all very probably the same thing -- and also that which he sought. Eagerly he read on. His next clue came from Bergson: Thought may begin with its object, and at last, in consistency, be driven, by the apparent necessities of logic, to conceive all things as forms and creatures of mind. Quickly he passed on to Spinoza where he found a wealth of food for thought. Is the body merely an idea? Is all the mentality that is scattered over space and time, a diffused consciousness that animates the. world? There is but one entity, seen now inwardly as mind, now outwardly as matter, but in reality an inextricable mixture and unity of both. Eternal order... that betokens the very structure of existence, underlying all events and things, and constituting the essence of the world. Substance is insubstantial, that it is form and not matter, that it had nothing to do with that mongrel and neuter composite of matter. Bruno said; All reality is one in substance, one in cause, one in origin; mind and matter are one. Descartes\\' conception of a homogeneous \"substance\" underlying all forms of matter intrigued him for a time, and he wrestled mentally with the classic quotation, I think, therefore I am. Berkeley wrote ; A thin is merely a bundle of perceptions -- i. fi., classified and interpreted sensations. Hegel: The Absolute, transcending the individual limitations and purposes, and catching, underneath the universal strife, the hidden harmony of all things. Reason is the substance of the universe. Leibniz; Although the whole of this life were said to be nothing but a dream, and the visible world nothing but a phantasm, I should call this dream or phantasm real enough, if, using reason well, we were never deceived by it. F or a time Buckmaster left the philosophers and read poetry. He found germs of what he sought in some of them, as Goethe\\'s, The force which draws the lover, and the force which draws the planets are one. He found it beautifully in a stanza of Wordsworth\\'s. Something Whose dwelling is the light of the setting suns, And the round ocean, and the living air,  And the blue sky, and the mind of man ; -- A motion and a spirit, all objects of all thought. And rolls through all things. In the main, however, he found in the poets that the grains of wheat wete too few amidst the chaff and Returned to philosophy. Most of these excerpts, he felt, were clues to the enigma of him self. He knew that these great minds had touched on the very mystery that puzzled him. Once again he felt on the verge of understanding. Did he have all the pieces? Could he fit them into the pattern, if he but knew how? Or must he need to learn more? Suddenly he found the explanation in a book of essays by, the incongruity of it struck him as ironical, an anonymous writer. He read : For a time, during the middle ages, the theory that all th world, and even the universe, were figments of one giant imagination, swayed the thinkers of the world. The intellect in which this imagination centered was focused in one man, and one man only, in the whole of existence. That man was the one fnan who Uhought. All other men all other matter, were but imagined props with no actual existence. That man is the one who Uhinks!\\' \\'You -- and only \"you, the person who is reading this -- in the whole world. It does not matter what your name might be. It might be...  Clifford Buckmaster knew then the mystery of life, who he was, and why. He no longer concentrated, but his eyes read on: At first glance it would seem that there is a con eerted conspiracy to avoid acknowledging this fact. Learned men, acquiring wisdom, come to the brink of the great discovery, and then deftly skirt it, blinding themselves to its evidentness. However, on second thought the reason is obvious, The theory is anarchistic ; it carries the seeds of its own futility. If they were ever to admit the truth of it, all reason for everything -- theit very discovery, their very thoughts -- would be futile. So they refuse to recognize it. Your obvious question is. How can I tell you this? Who am I -- the writer of this essay? The answer is quite simple. I am merely a figment of your imagination, as is everything else about you! At last he knew. His first sensation was one of awful, empty solitude. He was one creature -- alone. Alone in a universe! He was ah entity living in a dream world. All about him were the figments of an imagination -- presumably his own. And even knowing, he still had no control of events -- like a dream that cannot be halted or changed. The people about him were automatons, in fact they possessed no actual substance. Even his own body was but a figment -- but he could be hurt! He had experienced the most acute pain, and very probably he could be killed. He had, however, little time tb brood on it. At that instant in his reflections Gamoll jerked open the library door and walked in. \"The worst has happened,\" he exclaimed. \"The security police have caught Oliver\\' \"What can we do?\" Buckmaster still could not regard Gamoll, or Oliver and his friends, as nonentities. \"I hate to say this,\" Gamoll said, \"but you\\'ll have to get out, I may be able to help Oliver escape, but I\\'ll be powerless if they learn that I\\'m connected with the Underground.\" \"They probably wouldn\\'t hesitate to kill you also,\" Buckmaster said. \"That wouldn\\'t be too important, if my dying would accomplish anything,\" Gamoll said. \"But the Underground\\'s only hope seems to be my keeping clear.\" Slowly, almost unobtrusively, a vision rose up before Buckmaster\\'s eyes. Gamoll\\'s features clouded, became vague, and were gone. In his place stood the General. In the General\\'s hand was a bottle, and before him a wooden frame, holding a metal box with its lid open. Buckmaster realized that what he was seeing was happening in some see cement walls in the room in which the General stood, Probably the basement, he thought. Within him the Force commanded! He must get to the General, and kill him. The world was on the brink of disaster. And time was running out. posite vision vanished and he saw the handsome features of Gamoll again. He knew .what he had to do now. \"I\\'m leaving irhmediately,\" he said. Closing the library door behind him he walked unhesitatingly down a long hallway. To either side of him, painted on the walls, were murals, depicting peasants in the fields, harvesting grain. Idly he observed the painted figures as he walked, with his brain chilled and numbed of almost all emotion. The painted figures possessed as much reality as anything else about him, he thought disinterestedly. He w\\'alked down steps and across an inner courtyard, his legs moving stiffly, lifelessly. He continued up the steps on the far side of the courtyard, his mind shutting out everything around him except the door ahead. When he reached there he stopied. Here, he knew, he was at the crossroads. He could move straight ahead through the door, or he could walk around the house and enter the basement through the back. That was the longer way, but probably the safer. And the Force urged the second choice. A mood of black frustration swept over him and some perverse stubbornness of his human nature rebelled at this supine abnegation. He knew that he was going to die, and his one last defiant act would be to die in a way of his own choosing. He walked straight ahead. As he opened the door and stepped into a long green-carpeted room he found himself facing three guards. They held guns and the guns were all aimed at him. Even before he observed that the guards were firing, he felt the killing slugs enter his body. He knew the bullets had reached vital organs and that he was about to die. Within him he felt the Force, angry and rebuking. He felt a wrench at the cote of his body structure -- and he was walking -- walking -- endlessly -- down a long corridor. On the walls to either side of him were the figures of harvesters painted on yellow murals. His body was alive and vital. He walked on, through a doorway and out into a courtyard before he realized what had happened. The Force had turned time backward! He was once mote on his way to shoot Koski. He was exactly the same as he had been the last time but with the addition of his memories of having been shot. And the silent warning that came to him never to expect another second chance. That could not be repeated. This time when he came to the fatal door there was no surge of rebellion and he did not hesitate. He walked around the house until he came to the basement entrance. Cement steps led downward. Two guards were waiting for him there. One guard fell as Buckmaster fired, but he knew with a terrible Certainty that he would not be able to kill the other in time to save himself. The guard\\'s bullet crashed into Buckmasters diaphragm and his body jerked once but it did not stop its determined pacing forward. Buckmaster fired again but even as he did he felt a second bullet enter his body. It pierced his heart and he knew that he was dead. With dimming vision he watched the guard fall over on his side as his own bullet found its mark. Even as Buckmaster realised that the bitter fever of lif was over fdr him he knew that his body Would not stop. Without any directive frorn the brain it was using the last of the suspended energy in its blood and muscles to walk forward, driving with ah awful exertion. On he walked into the cement lined room. The General stood there, oblivious to the noise about him. The hair on the crown of his head parted violently as the bullet from the guri in Buckmaster\\'s hand hfts mark. The gun became a weight too heavy for Buckmaster\\' s lifeless fingers and dropped to the floor. The last spark of life flickered for a brief moment where it had fled ih some inner recess of his brain and he felt the Force for the last time. Two words it spoke. \"Well done,\" and he knew that at last his job was finished. Now he would return home! B uckmaster had reasoned well, considering his natural limitations. But the ttuth he had discovered was, like most truths, only part of a greater truth. In the far reaches of infinity, beyond the outermost boundaries of space, a thoughtvoice spoke. \"Am I going to die?\" it asked. \"Not now,\\' a second entity answered. \"The crisis is past.\" \\'Will the sickness come again ?\\' \"Not this particular form of rrialevolent psychosis,\" the second entity replied. \"But perhaps you had better tell me all the facts you know so that I can advise you about the future.\" \"My project, I still believe, was magnificent,\" the sick entity began. \"From the energy of my essence I materialized a world of infinitesimal creatures. I gave them time and space, and built a background of a universe for their wonderment and speculation. They dwelt on their world, lived their lives, and made their tiny, though admirable, advances as they saw their destiny. And then, suddenly, when all seemed beautiful, something went wrong, and I was ill unto death. What did I do that was not right?\" \"I believe you made your mistake when you gave your creatures free will. \\'They developed their malignancies, as well as their admirabilities. When they developed a malignancy of such virulence that they were in a position to destroy themselves, you made yourself vulnerable to death, through them. The shock of that devastation to you would have killed you. Tell me, weYe your creatures aware that they were figments of your mind?\" \"Some grasped inklings of it, though none were certain. One, a Baruch Spinoza, came as close to the truth as it was possible, for their finite minds. He wrote: We are the flitting forms of a being greater than ourselves and endless while We die. Our bodies are cells in the body of the race, our race is an incident in the drama\\' of life; our minds are the fitful flashes of an eternal light. Our mind, in so far as it understands, is an eternal mode of thinking, which is determined by another mode of thinking, and this one again by another, anfl so on to infinity. That was magnificant. While others who caught inklings of the truth believed that I was an ultimate being, he realized that I, too, had an ultimate being whom I j worshipped.\" j \"Also, if he had been able to per ceive how close you were to death,\" I the second entity said, \"he would  have realized that you were mortal,  which no ultimate being can be.\" \"How were you able to circumvent the disaster that so nearly befell me?\" \"I sent a segment of my own mentality into your conceived world. I gave it a name, implanted a memory of a past into its mind, \\' and that same memory into the ! minds of those creatures with whom ; it was supposed to have come into contact, in its past. Through that i segment I was able to destroy the awful potentiality, as well as the creature who controlled it. The ; secret now rests with the dead.\" \"Is there any chance of a similar  recurrence?\" \"That chance will always exist j as long as you persist in allowing your creatures to have free will. I i would advise you to destroy it.\" For a time the patient was silent. \"No,\" it said finally, \"without that free will their existence and my entire project would be futile. I will let the free will remain and bear any consequences.\"  \"That, of course, is your own choosing,\" the other said. And so man kept his greatest possession. By Ezra Shaw The Eterfidl Riddle What kind of life? Does it exist in any one of th forms recognizable to us? Or does the spirit of life -- \"if any -- which may emanate elsewhere than on Earth breed a species totally unfamiliar to anything we can possibly imagine? Before looking for the answel to these questions, it is necessary to know certain facts ut the makeup of the planets. First -- do they have atmosphere? Atmosphere consists of a body of gases -- an aggregation of molecules in a state of perpetual motion -- surrounding a planet. The density of the gaseous atmosphere of the Earth or of any other planet decreases with an increasing distance from the surface of the planet. Near the upper limit of the atmosphere, where the density is very low, the molecules will travel for a considerable distance between collisions with other molecules If a molecule in this region happens to rebound after a collision in an outward direction and with a speed much greater than the average speed, it may escape into outer space, provided that it does not come into collision with any other molecule. For any particle, whether large or small, to be able to escape altogether, it is necessary that its velocity exceed a certain critical value -- the velocity of escape. This value is important in considering planetary atmospheres. tain height falls to the ground with an accelerated velocity because of the attracting force of gravity. If the stone is projected upwards with a velocity equal to that at which it hits the ground, its velocity will progressively decrease. Now -- forgetting gravitational attractions of other bodies in the atmosphereif the stone is dropped towards Earth from an infinitely great height, it will fall with a gradually increasing velocity which, when it reaches the ground, will have a definite velocity value. Using ,\"V\" as the velocity value, \"G\" as the Value of the constant of gravitation, \"M\" for the mass of the Earth and as its radius ; equals #GMrf Now, if the stone is projected upwards with a force equal to the velocity V, it will reach an infinitely great distance before it comes to rest ; if it is projected with a velocity less than V, it will eventually come to rest and then, fall back to Earth, because any velocity less than V corresponds to the velocity acquired in falling to the ground from a height that is finite. Thus, the stone can only get completely away from the Earth if its initial velocity is equal to or greater than V. This is why V is called the \"velocity of escape\". To determine the velocity necessary for any body to escape from the Earth, simply substitute the values for the constant of gravitation, and for the mass and radius of the Earth. In this way it can be found that the velocity of escape from the Earth is #.I miles a second. N ot a single molecule of the Earth\\'s atmosphere can possibly escape into outer space unless its velocity exceeds the escape velocity. But whenever a molecule rebounds away from the Earth with a speed greater than the escape velocity, it will escape from the Earth\\'s gravitation, provided that it does not collide with any other molecule. A loss of the faster moving molecules from the outer layers of the atmosphere is inevitable. There are various tnathematical principles concerning the velocity of escape of a molecule from its atmosphere. The actual calculations were made some years ago by Sir James Jeans, who found that if the velocity of escape is four times the average molecular velocity, the atmosphere would be practically completely lost in # years. If the velocity of escape is four and a half times the average molecular velocity, the atmosphere would be lost in # years. If the velocity of escape is five times the average molecular velocity, # quired for complete loss. On the basis of these figures, then, the large planets as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, may j be expected to have atmosphere  much more extensive than that of Earth. Venus\\' would be comparaI ble to Earth\\'s. The atmosphere of  Mars is probably considerably thin ner than that of Earth, while Mer; cury and the Moon would have ; little or no atmosphere. j The Spectroscope  Assuming that a planet has i z  an atmosphere, the spectroI scope is used to study the compKJsir  tion of the planet. This instrument contains one or more prisms, the light from the planet is passed , through the spectroscope, and ; spreads out into a band or spectrum i showing the colors of the rainbow. Each point in the spectrum correj sponds to the definite wave-length. If sunlight is being analyzed --  the light being admitted through a : narrow slit -- the spectrum becomes  crossed by thousands of fine dark lines, each of which corresponds to \\' a definite wave-length and a definite intensity. When an electric spark from between two pieces of iron is piassed through, the spectrum shows a considerable number of bright lines, spaced at irregular intervals and of different intensities. This particular series of lines is produced by no other element but iron. In a similar way, every other element has its own characteristic spectrum. If light from a hot in. candescent source which has a continuous spectrum showing all the colors of the rainbow is passed through the vapor of iron at a lower temperature, the continuous spectrum of the hot source will be crossed by a number of dark lines, each of which is exactly identical in wave-length with one of the bright lines in the spectrum of the incandescent iron vapor. Such a spectrum is called an absorption spectrum. The lines in the spectrum of the Sun are of this nature. The hot interior of the Sun would give a continuous spectrum, but the cooler outer layers absorb the radiations of various wave-lengths, thus producing the dark lines. These fine dark lines are known as the Fraunhofer lines -- so named after the physicist who first investigated them. Investigation of the spectrum of sunlight proves that iron is contained in the Sun. Similarly, the presence of many other elements are detected, as well as some fairly reliable conclusions as to their abundance. The Effect of Atmosphere however, enters into the analysis of light from the Sun. Since we make our observations from the bottom of Earth\\'s atmosphere, the light from the Sun has to pass through this atmosphere before it reaches us, and some of it is of necessity absorbed in the atmosphere. Consequently, some of the absorption lines that are present in the observed spectrum of the Sun do not originate in the Sun, but in Earth\\'s atmosphere. Of particular importance is the absorption produced by the small amount of ozone in the atmosphere. This is so strong that all of the light of wave-length shorter than # inch is completely absorbed, and none of the light in this region -- the ultra-violet region of the spectrum -- is accessible to observation. In analyzing the spectrum of the Sun, the question arises regarding both the absorptions that originate in the Sun itself and those that are produced by Earth\\'s atmosphere. There are two ways in which the absorptions of terrestrial origin can be identified: ( I ) Compare the spectra of the Sun taken at different altitudes. The lower the altitude of the Sun, the longer the path that the light from the Sun has to travel through the atmosphere in order to reach Earth. (#) Compare the spectra of light from the east and west limbs of the Sun. Since the Sun rotates on its axis in about # days, the west limb is moving away from Earth while the east limb moves towards us. There is a slight separation between the corresponding absorptions in the light from the two regions. The absorptions that originate in our atmosphere are not affected by the Sun\\'s rotations; these coincide in position in the spectra of the light from the two opposite limbs. If, then, the spectra of the eastern and western limbs of the Sun are photographed simultaneously or in immediate succession on the same plate, the absorptions of Earth origin can be immediately picked out, because they consist of all tKe obSofptions that coincide in position in the two spectra. advantageous than the first because it does not necessitate the comparison of spectra obtained at different altitudes and at different times. The planets are cool bodies having no intrinsic light of their own. A planet is seen only by means of the light from the Sun that falls upon it and is reflected. As the sunlight penetrates into the atmosphere of the planet, it is partially scat tered and partially absorbed. The depth to which it penetrates depends upon the nature and extent of the atmosphere; in some cases the light may not even reach to the surface of the planet. Since the light will bear some impress of its passage into and out of the atmosphere of the planet, when it is analysed by the spectroscope, absorptions that have originated in the atmosphere of the planet may be revealed which will give some clues to the nature of the atmosphere. An absorption in the atmosphere of the planet that does not correspond with any absorptions produced in the atmosphere of the Earth will be easily noted. Where, however, the absorptions will coincide with those produced by the same substances in the Earth\\'s atmosphere, care is required to decide whether these ise in the atmosphere of the Earth, or whether they include the effect of absorptions originating in the atmosphere of the other planet. The two substances whose presence in the planetary atmosphere is of the greatest significance for the possibility of the existence of life, are oxygen and water vapor, and it these two substances whose presence may be most difficult to establish. There are two methods to distinguish whether an absorption is of terrestrial origin or of planetary origin : ( I ) Compare the spectrum of the planet with that of the Moon, obtaining the two on the same night and as nearly as possible to the same time, and at equal altitudes. Since the Moon is devoid of atmosphere, if any absorption is present it must originate in that of the planet. (#) The second method is based on the displacement of the absorption lines in the light from a moving source at a time when the planet is approaching or receding from the Earth most rapidly. The relative motion will displace the absorption due to the planet\\'s atmosphere with respect to those due to our own atmosphere, and in this way it is possible to detect planetary absorptions of low intensity. This method is a very delicate one, and is especially useful for deciding whether substances that are present in our owti atmosphere are also present in the atmosphere of the other planet. temperature -- a Decisive Factor possibility of life on a particular planet, it is necessary that we have some general idea of its temperature conditions. Mercury -- which has very little or no atmosphere -- always keeps the same side toward the Sun. Suppose this planet has no heat output of its own, but that there is an exact balance between the heat that it receives from the Sun and that which it radiates into space. It would be simple to estimate the temperature of its surface by figuring according to Stefan\\'s law -- that the total radiation from a body is proportioned to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. Using this observed value and equating the energy received and radiated, the highest temperature at any point on the surface of a planet that always turns the same face to the Sun, can be found, provided that the planet has no atmosphere and that it is a body that completely absorbs all the radiations falling on it. The dark side of the planet which receives no heat from thp Sun would be extremely cold. If the planet does not always turn the same side to the Sun, the effect of its rotation would be to lower the noonday temperature and to raise the night temperature. The faster the rotation, the smaller the difference between the day and night temperatures. For a sufficiently fast rotation, there would be no difference between day and night temperatures at any place on the planet; there would be, however, a variation of temperature with latitude, because the average rate of reception of heat from the Sun depends on the latitude. fects come into play on a planet that possess an atmosphere and, as on Earth, temperatures at any one place may differ considerably from day to day. The general  effect of an atmosphere, ,then, is a smoothing-out of the temperature differences between day and night, because there will be a persistent tendency for heat to be carried from the warmer to the cooler parts of the surface by warm air moving into colder regions and cold air moving into warmer regions. Too, the atmosphere of the Earth, and probably most planetary atmospheres, are opaque in many regions of the infra-red, corresponding to long wave-length radiations. Most of the solar heat is transmitted by the atmosphere, warming the surface of the planet, and much of this heat is radiated again as radiation of considerably longer wave-length, to which the atmosphere is opaque. The temperature is therefore raised considerably. The atmosphere exerts a blanketing effect by preventing the escape of the radiations of long wave-length. Then the fall of temperature at night become less rapid. The Nature and Use of the Bolometer junction with a sensitive detector of radiation, is used to measure the radiation received on the Earth from the planets. A bolometer or a thermocouple may be used for detecting and measuring the radiation. In the bolometer, the radiant energy is focused on to a minute strip of, platinum which forms one arm of an electrical circuit known as a Wheatstone\\'s bridge. A similar strip, shielded from the radiation, forms a second arm of# the bridge, which is bah anced against the first. When the radiant energy falls on the first arm of the bridge, it is heated, its resistance is increased, the balance of the bridge is upset and a current flows through the galvanometer of the bridge. The deflection of the galvanometer provides a measure of the intensity of the radiation falling on the bolometer. The thermocouple consists of a small junction of two tiny .strips of different metals. When the junction is heated, a thermoelectric current, whose strength is proportional to the intensity of the radiation, flows through the circuit and is measured by a sensitive galvanometer. A highly sensitive thermocouple will detect the heat from a candle at a distance of three miles bolometer provides a measure of the total radiation from the planetj as modified by absorption in the Earth\\'s atmosphere. A slight correction must be applied to the measures to allow for this effect. A measure of the total planetary radiation is obtained when it is applied. This consists in part of reflected sunlight and in part of the lowtemperature longwave radiation from the planet itself. It is the latter portion that provides inforfnation about the planet\\'s temperature. It is necessary, therefore, to separate it from the portion that is merely reflected sunlight. The separation is easily effected by placing a small transparent vessel containing water in the path of the rays. The water transmits the portion of the radiation of relatively short waVe-length -- the reflected sunlight portion but hi opaque to the long-wave planetary portion Thus, the true heat radiation from the planet is measured. If atmosphere and ternperatufe have a similarity to that of Earth\\'s, we can safely assume that the planet has life similar to that here on Earth. But if these factors vary in any great degree, then living matter if such etists -- will be in, a nature of which we have no knowledge. Ten miracles were arranged for the agelong flight. But they reckoned without T he seventh tub shook gently, stimulating the hypothalamic region of Eric\\'s brain for the first time in almost two centuries. After a time, his limbs trembled and his body began to shiver. The liquid in which he floated boiled off at a temperature still far below that which would permit his body to function. By the time all the liquid was gone he had uncurled and lay at the bottom of the tub. Now his heart pumped three hundred times a minute, generating warmth and activating his central nervous system. It took many hours for his heart to slow -- not back to the one beat every two minutes it had known for a hundred-seventy five years, but to the normal rate of about seventy per minute. By then his body temperature had climbed from below freezing to # F. Eric lay in stupor for a week, while fluids flowed into the tub and massaged his muscles, while fatty tissue slowly turned into strength. Finally, he climbed from his tub. He found the locker which bore his name, and opened it. Six other lockers were open and empty, as were six tubs. He found that hard to believe. It had seemed only a night of deep and dreamless sleep, no more. But each empty tub stood for twenty-five years, each open locker meant a man had gone and lived his time with the new generations of the ship, perhaps had sired children, had died with old age.  Eric found his clothing on a At intervals of twenty-five years, they would arise to police the ship. hook, took it down. Yesterday -- he laughed mirthlessly when he realized that had been almost two hundred years ago -- Clair had told him something about a note. He found it in the breast pocket of his jumper, stiff and yellow. He read: Darling: I will he ashes in the void between the stars when you read this. That sounds silly, but ifs the truth -- unless I can give old Methuselah a run for his money; I sadden when I think that you will be gone tomorrow, the same as dead. But if they need ten and if you are one who can withstand suspension -- what can we do? Know that my love goes with you across the ages, Eric. I just thought of something. Youll be the seventh of ten, with the last one coming out at planetfall. If you live to be a real graybeard, you might even see the landing on the Centaurian planet. I love you. Clair -- If Clair had married, her great grandchildren might be alivmow. Her great great grandchildren would be Eric\\'s age. Clair\\'s progeny, not Clair -- because Clair was dust now, a light year back in space -- He found a package of cigarettes in his jumper, took one out and lit it. He must not think, of the past, not when it was only history now although he still felt very much a part of it. Today mattered, today and the new generations on the ship. It crossed his mind that they might regard him almost as a god, a man who had seen Earth, who had slept while generations lived and died, who came from his impossible sleep and would live with them now to see that everything was going according to plan. Three minutes after he started the mechanism, the door slid ponderously into the wall. It would open more simply from the other side, he knew, but then only Eric and the three who still slept could turn its complex tumblers. For a long while he stood there on the threshold and then he watched the door slide back into place. soft white light, which meant it was daytime on the ship. Dimly in the distance, Eric heard voices, children at play. Would they know of him? Would their parents know? Was he expected? Eric came closer. Through a doorway he could see the children, three of them, although they had not yet seen him. A chubby, frecklefaced boy said : \"Let\\'s play Lazarus. I must be the Captain, and you, Janie, you can be the crew. George, you be Lazarus.\" George was a big ten-year-old with dark hair. \"Like heck I will! It was your idea, you be Lazarus, smart guy.\" Eric stepped through the doorway. \"Hello,\" he said. \"Gan you take me to your folks?\" \"Who\\'re you. Mister?\" \"Hey, I don\\'t know him I Where\\'d he come from?\" The girl, Janie, said, \"Lookit his clothes. Lookit. They\\'re different.\" The children wore loose tunics. pastel-tinted, to their kilees. Freckle-Face said: \"You know what today is, doncha?\" George frowned. \"Yeah, holiday We\\'re off from school.\" \"What holiday, stupid? Which one?\" \"I -- I dunno.\" \"Lazzy-day!\" Janie cried, \"That\\'s what it is. Then he\\'s --  he\\'s -- \" \"Lazarus!\" Freckle-Face told her, and, as if on One inipulse, the three of them bolted away from Eric, disappeared through another doorway. He did not follow them. He stood there, waiting, and before long he heard footsteps returning. A man entered the room, tall, thin, middleaged. \"You are Eric Taine,\" he said, smiling. \"I\\'m sorry no one was around to greet you, but the way We had it figured, yOu wouldn\\'t come out till later this afternoon. History says that\\'s how it worked with the six before you, about fouf P.M. It\\'s just noon now. Will yoU follow me, please?\" Then the man flushed faintly. \"Excuse me, but it isn\\'t often we meet strangers. Everyone knows everyone else of course. My name is Lindquist, Mr. Taine. Roger Lindquist.\" Eric shook hands with him, stiffly, and he thought for a moment the man did not know the gesture, \"Ah yes, handshaking,\" Lindquist laughed. \"We simply show empty palms iiow, you know. But then, you don\\'t know. I rather imagine you\\'ll have a lot to learrt.\" Eric nodded, asked Lindquist ii he might be shown about the hip. There was a lot he had to see, td check, to change if change were needed. \"Relax, my friend,\" Lindquist told him. \"I\\'d -- ah, like to suggest that we postpone your tour until you\\'ve met with our Council this afternoon. I\\'d very much like to suggest that.\" Eric shrugged, saidt \"You know more about this than I do, Mr. Lindquist. We\\'ll wait for \\' your . Council meeting.\" X Captain Larkinj hours later, \"tradition has it that you become a king. King Lazarus Seven -- with six Lazaruses before you. The first one, the histories say, was a joke. But it\\'s stuck ever since. The people like this idea of a king who coitiea to them every twenty five years --  and they\\'ve dubbed him with the name Lazarus, well, because if he didn\\'t come back from the dead, he came back from something a lot like it.\" Efft nodded. \"What happened to Alan Bridges?\" \"Who?\" This was Lindquist \"Alan Bridges, the man before me -- your Lazarus Six.\" Captain Larkin cleared his throat. \"He\\'s dead, Mr. Taine.\" \"Dead? He\\'d only be in his fifties now -- \" \"I know. Sad. It was disease, hit him soon after he came to us. Lazarus Six had a very short reign. Didn\\'t he, Mr. Lindquist?\" \"He certainly did,\" Lindquist agreed. \"Let\\'s hope that Lazarus Seven is here to step down for Eight-and to Watch Nine come in, fifty years from now!\" Cheers filled the room and Eric smiled briefly. That reminded him of Clair\\'s note. Clair -- \"So,\" said Captain Larkin, \"you\\'ll be crowned tomorrow. After that, your people will see you. King Lazarus Seven on his throne. Don\\'t disappoint us, Mr. Taine. Their tradition means a lot to them.\" \"It should,\" Eric said. \"The planners made it that way. With nothing but space outside, and the confining walls of the ship, they needed something to bind them together.\" \"Yes,that\\'s true. But the people, as you\\'ll see, have come up with some of their own traditions over the years.\" Captain Larkin ran a hand through his graying hair. \"Like your kinghood, for example. You\\'ll see, Mr. Taine -- or should it be Lazarus now, eh?\" He laughed. \"If you\\'d like,\" Eric said. He did not relish the idea particularly, but then, it was their show. Still, he had everything to check -- from as t rogation to ethics -- and he would not want to be delayed by pomp and ceremony. Well, there was time enough for that. Now he felt weary -- and that made him chuckle, because he had just concluded a hundred-seventy five year nap. They took him to his quarters, where the six before him had lived. There he ate in silence, food from the hydroponic gardens on a lower level of the ship. The line of light under his door had turned from white to a soft blue. It was night on the ship. Eric showered and got into bed, but although he was tired he could not fall asleep. He had expected to be an efficiency expert of sorts ; that was his job ; but they told him, matter-of-factly, that he would be a king. Well, you could expect change in nearly two hundred years, radical change. And if indeed their tradition were deep-rooted, he would not try to change it. The planners had counted on that to keep them going, because there could be no environmental challenge to goad them. Just an unreal past and an unreal Earth which Eric and their great-great grandparents had seen, and an even more unreal future when, someday far far off, the ship reached the Centaurian System. Softly, someone knocked at his door. The sound had been there for many moments, a gentle tapping, but it had not registered on his consciousness. Now, when it did, he padded across the bare floor and opened the door, A girl stepped in from the corridor, pushing him before her with one hand, motioning him to silence with the other. She closed the door softly behind her, soundlessly almost, and turned to face him. She wore the knee-length tunic popular with this generation, and it covered a graceful feminine figure. Ju \"Please listen to me, Eric Taine. I may have only a few moments -- listen!\" \"Sure,\" he smiled, \"But why all the mystery?\" \"Shh! Let me talk Have you a weapon?\" \"Yes, I carry a pistol. I don\\'t fancy I\\'ll need it, though.\" \"Well, take it with you and go back where you came. If anyone tries to stop you, use your weapon They have nothing like it. Then, when you get there -- \" Her voice came breathlessly, and it made Eric laugh. \"Hold on, Miss. Why should I do that? Don\\'t tell me there\\'s a plot and someone wants to usurp the new king before he\\'s crowned? No? What then?\" \"Stop making fun of rAe, Eric Taine. I\\'m trying to save yer life\" lShe said it so seriously, her eyes so big and round, that Eric half wanted to believe her. But that was fantastic. From what could she possibly be saving him? The words came out in a rush as the girl spoke again. \"The ship is not on course. For twenty five years it has been off, heading back to Earth -- \" \"To Earth! That\\'s crazy.\" \"Listen, please. They killed Lazarus Six. He was a scapegoat. They watched the old films of Earth and felt they had been cheated out of their birthright. Why should they live here, alone in spate? they said. Why should their children\\'s children face the hardships of a new world? They didn\\'t ask for it. It was thrust upon them by the planners, by your generation. If they knew how to get into your room of tubs, they would have killed you. Now there is a mock ceremony, everything is blamed on the new  Lazarus and the people feel better when he is killed. I know, my mother told me. You can ask her -- \" The girl was about twenty, Eric thought. A wild-eyed thing now, who so wanted him to believe her impossible story. Her breath came quickly, in little gasps, and Eric tried to hide the smile on his face. \"You\\'re laughing at me! Stupid, stupid -- please -- And when you get back to your room of tubs, awaken your friends, the three who remain. You four can control the ship, put it back on course, teach the people -- Ooo, stop laughing!\" She pouted prettily \"All of us, we\\'re not all like that. We who are not can help you.\" Eric chuckled softly. \"You try to picture it,\" he told her, \"I\\'m sorry, but everything\\'s been sweetness and light, and you come in here with a wild notion -- \" \"It isn\\'t wild, it\\'s the truth. Why don\\'t you ask to check our course before they make you king?\" He could do that, all right. But they\\'d be wondering what mad neurosis copipelled his actions, and he did not Want that, not when he might have so much to do \"Check it,\" she pleaded. And when he shook his head, she told him, \"You\\'re acting like a child, you know. The records say you are twenty-five, and you\\'ve slept for seven times that, but still. All you have to do is check Please -- \" The door burst in upon them and Lindquist stood there, With Captain Larkin and twp others. Lindquist shook his head sadly. \"I thought so,\" he said. Captain Larkin nodded. \"A Cultist child. Shame, isn\\'t it?\" One of the other men strode forward, and the girl cowered behind Eric. \"Don\\'t believe them!\" she wailed. \"Lies -- \\' \"There are so many of them,\" Lindquist explained. \"Apparently, we\\'re in an area of high radiation now, Mr. Taine. So many of our people are deranged. I won\\'t guess at the cause, except to say it\\'s probably outside the ship.\" The man came around Eric, tchtch\\'d when the girl jurrped on the bed and stood trembling against the headboard. \"Now, Laurie,\" the man coaxed. \"Come on down, there\\'s a good girl.\" Eric wanted to help her, but he checked the impulse. He only felt protective. There could be nothing in the girl\\'s story. Best if they took her and treated her. \"... a whole cult of them,\" Lindquist was saying. \"All lacking something up here.\" He tapped his head. \"They don\\'t trust anyone, only members. Think we\\'re doing all sorts of foolish things. I don\\'t know, what would you call it in your day. Paranoia?\" Eric said he didn\\'t know, he was not a psychologist. He watched silently with Lindquist and Captain Larkin as the two other men took Laurie, struggling, out the door. She kicked, bit, and cried lustily. Once her dark eyes caught Eric\\'s gaze, held it, and she whimpered, \"I don\\'t care if they kill you! I don\\'t care -- \" They started down the corridor, after Lindquist said, \"You\\'ve had a hard day. I think we\\'d better let you sleep.\" \"She told you someone wanted to kill you?\" Captain Larkin said, shaking his head slowly. \"What can we do, Lindquist?\" \"Well, we just better hope whatever\\'s causing this sort of thing is left behind in space soon. Goodnight Mr. Taine.\" \"Goodnight, Lazarus,\" said Captain Larkin. E ric recognized at once the great hall in which he had danced that last night with Clair. Ipw Clair was gone. The place was crowded -- probably the ship\\'s entire population. Lindquist led him through the crowd, and he could not tell what their faces showed. There were mumblings of \"Lazarus\" and \"king\" -- but why did he get the faint suggestion of mockery? Oddly, what Laurie said had troubled him -- he had had a bad night\\'s sleep, and it left him irritable. Poor girl. He wondered how many more there were like her. Well, in time he could find out, after this nuisance of a coronation had become history. \"Ah, Taine,\" Captain Larkin said as Lindquist brought him to the dais. \"As you can see, all the people are ready. I hope you won\\'t think the ceremony foolish. Are you ready?\" Eric nodded, watched a man raise trumpet to lips, blow one clarion note. A hush fell over the hall. \"I am honored to present King Lazarus Seven to you,\" Larkin proclaimed in a loud clear voice. \"He has been sent, as you know, by the planners.\" Hoots from the crowd. Eric frowned. He had thought they would respect the planners, the men whose vision had sent Man -- here in this ship -- outward bound to the stars. Larkin\\'s voice was honey now. \"Don\\'t judge our new king by those who s#til him Don\\'t -- \" Laughter, and shouts of \"Hailj Lazarus!\" The people, Eric suddenly realized, were almost primitive, Larkin and Lindquist and a handful of others ran the ship, had somehow maintained the science of another generation. But the lack f conflict, of challenge, had sent the people down a rung or two on the ladder of civilization. Handpicked, their ancestors had been -- but they were a common mob Someone cried, \"He\\'s seen Earth. Ask him to tell us about Earth!\" \"Ask himVl Captain Larkin smiled. \"Tell them, Taine. Tell your new subjects. You have so little time.\" \"What do you mean, so little time?\" . \"Tell them!\" And Larkin turned away, laughing. They were primitive, these people, and as the girl Laurie had said, they needed a scapegoat. They didn\\'t like it here on the ship. There had been a first generation which had known Earth and could savor its flavor through the long years like a delicate wine, And there Would be a last which could get out on the Centaurian planet, stretch its legs, and build civilization anew. But these in between were in limbo. They lived and they died on the ship, and it wasn\\'t their idea. They would breed so that the ship would still have a crew when it reached Gentauri. That was their function. But they didn\\'t like it. All this went through Eric\\'s mind. Perhaps the girl had no psychosis, perhaps her warning had been sincere. He wondered if the loner sleen had dulled his instincts. his reflexes He told them of Earth, of its wonders, of the wide meadows he remembered, of the wind, brisk in spring, which brought the sweet scented rain, of summer and the big harvest moon which followed, of a hundred other things. Glair! Clair! Did yoU marry  have children? There was that Lou Sorfiebody who youd flirt with to mdke me jealous, hut we both knew he loved you, I wonder He spoke of the planners, of the proud day when all the world had seen them off, the video jets flashing by, circling, to send their picThe planners, he told them, had a vision. It was the same vision which had first taken man -- an ape with a brain that held curious half formed thoughts that gave him a headache -- down from the trees. A vision which would Carry him one day to the farthest stars and beyond. They shouted. They stamped oh the floor. They laughed. \"What about us? We didn\\'t have any say, did we? Who wants to spend his whole life in this tin can?\" \"I don\\'t know -- \" One of them at least was dubious, but the crowd stilled him. What of Laurie and her Cult? He did not see the girl anywhere in the great hall. \"We\\'ve had enough, Captain. Too much, I\\'d say!\" Larkin looked smug. Lindquist was grinning. No one did anything to stop them as the qrowd surged forward, threatened. Watching them only now beginning to realize the whole things Eric remembered history. Mock-kinghood was nothing new in the scheme of primitive cultures. In ancient Babylonia, in Assyria -- elsewhere -- The mock king ruled for a day and the people came to him with their troubles. The king, cowering on his throne-of-a-day could perhaps sec his executioner waiting. The real king had nothing to lose: the pent up dissatisfaction of his people would drown the mock-ruler like a wave, and after it was all over the king would return to his throne with more power than before. R ough hands reached up, grabbed at him. Fists shook, voice;# threatened. Someone pulled his boot, and Eric sat down on the dais, breathing heavily. He got up fast, before they could swarm all over him, yanked the gun from his jumper, poked it against Larkin\\'s ribs. \"You know what this is?\" \"Yes -- a gun.\" \"Well, call your friends off or I\\'ll kill you. I\\'m not\\' joking, Larkin. Call them off -- \" \\'T can\\'t. Look at them, a mob. What can I do now?\" \"You\\'d better do something, because soon you won\\'t have a chance to do anything. Now!\" Larkin made a motion to the trumpeteer. He blew two loud notes this time, and uniformed men appeared, brandishing clubs. Evidently, they were on hand in case the crowd became too wild, threatened Larkin, Lindquist and the other nameless rulers. With their clubs they beat the mob back, slowly, held them off as Eric pushed Larkin before him. The crowd surged close, fought once or twice with the guards on their immediate flanks. Once Larkin tried to bolt away, but thereafter Eric held him firmly until they reached an exit. Together they sprinted down a corridor, Larkin puffing and staggering. \"Beat it,\" Eric told him. \"Go on, scram!\" \"You won\\'t kill me as I run? I know that thing can kill over long distances -- \" \"Don\\'t give me any ideas,\" Eric said, but he felt a little sick as Larkin ran, whimpering, back toward the ha,ll. This man was their ruler, their leader. He found the door, activated its mechanism, waited impatiently while he heard the sounds of pursuit. Something clanged against the door, and again. They were throwing things. Eric ducked, felt pain stab at his shoulder. He could see their faces in the corridor when the door began to slide clear. He slipped in, punched the levers that would close it again, saw a hand and a leg come through the crack, heard a scream. The limbs withdrew, and Eric watched grimly as it slid all the way shut. Lazaruses Eight, Nine, and Ten, he thought, as he went to the three remaining tubs. For a moment he gazed down through the pinkish liquid at the men curled up, sleeping their long sleep. He shook the tubs gently. All it would take was that -- direct rnotion. Once that had started the cycle, each sleeper\\'s hypothalamus took over, twentyfive, fifty, and seventy-five years ahead of schedule He watched them twitch, shiver, slowly uncurl, watched the vapors rising from theii; tubs. He had plenty of time. In a week, he helped them from their tubs. They were ready to listen -- smiling baby-faced Chambers, gaunt Striker, rotund Richardson. He ecplained, slowly. He told them eveiything. \"My God,\" Striker said when he had finished. \"Be thankful you could get back here, lad,\" Richardson told him. \"What do we do now?\" \"What can we do?\" Chambers demanded. Then: \"Will you look at that -- a hundred seventjy five years and I haven\\'t even grown a beard!\" They all laughed, and the tension was broken. \"We go back,\" Eric said, \"armed to the teeth. It won\\'t be difficult. Some of them will die, but we can set the ship on its course again, teach them -- I\\'d hate to see the disappointment on Earth if we went back after six generations.\" Striker frowned. \"Have we the right to kill?\\' Eric said, \"look -- they might get back to Earth someday -- their progeny a bunch of savages; the hope and dreams of the race reduced tp -- nothing. We can kill if we have to.\" It was agreed. Without saying anything,\\' Striker himself activated the lock. them in the corridor, howling  \"Lazarus\" and \"death.\" It was Striker who shot them where they stood, before they could use the ; clubs. After that, they fired shots into the air, and people ran screaming away from them. Their first rush carried them almost to the control room and briefly Eric remembered when he had looked out from there with Clair at the bright faraway stars. But he could not quite picture j Clair\\'s face. He tried to, but he saw j the girl, Laurie... j A dozen uniformed men stood  before the control room. They  looked badly frightened, but they i stood their grouncf, then advanced.  \"What do we do now?\" Chambers asked. \"We couldn\\'t get them all, not before -- \" There was a rush behind them as a score of figures marched into the corridor \"We\\'re trapped!\" Striker cried. Eric grinned. \"I don\\'t think so.\" He had seen Laurie in the vanguard of the newcomers. They did not have to use their guns, not as they had been meant to be used. They fought with tooth and nail, using the guns as clubs. But mostly, they stood back and watched their allies tedr into the guards. The girl Laurie cried: \"I told you there were some who believed, Eric Taine. I told you!\" They reached the control room door, battered at it. Half a dozen men came up with a great post of metal, heaved. The door shuddered. Again. Again. It crashed iii Lindquist and Lafkih stood there, over a great pile of charts and books. \"You won\\'t take this ship on to Centauri,\" Larkin yelled, A little flame flickered at the end of the tube in his hand. He crouched, \"If those are the astrogation charts -- \" said Striker. Eric dove, caught Larkin\\'s midsection with his shoulder, threw the man back. They struggled on the floor, and dimly Eric was aware of others who held the writhing Lindquist. Larkin fought like a snake,  twisting, turning, gouging. Eric, out of the corner of his eye, saw Lindquist breaking loose, watched him running with the brand to the pile of charts. A shot crashed through the room, echoing hollowly. Lindquist fell over his charts. Now Eric had Larkin down, was pinning him, felt the man\\'s hands twisting, clawing at his stomach, saw them come away with his gun. They grappled, and Eric cursed himself for forgetting the gun, Larkin held it, laughed, squeezed the trigger as Eric pushed clear. Then the laughter faded as Larkin stared stupidly at the gun he had not known how to use. Larkin gasped once, held both hands to the growing red stain on his middle. later. \"They\\'re both dead. You know, I think it\\'s better this way. They w\\'ould have been trouble. But now -- now all we have to do is find the course again, turn the ship around -- \" \"It\\'ll mean two extra generations in space,\" Chambers said. \"They\\'ve been heading back for Earth twenty-five years.\" With Eric, he studied the charts, assembled them, punched a few buttons on the computing machine. \"Like this,\" Eric said. He twirled a few dials. \"It takes a long time with the overdrive, but we\\'ll be back on course in three years.\" For a while he gazed out the port, fascinated by the huge sweep of the Milky Way, clear and beautiful in the black sky. When he turned back and away from it, Laurie stood beside him. \"Hello, Lazarus.\" \"Very funny,\" he said. \"Call me Taine -- better still, call me Eric.\" \"Eric, then. Hello, Eric.\" He grinned. \"I guess you\\'re not psychotic, after all.\" \"Nope. Normal as can be. But take my great great grandmother, now. She was really neurotic. She married, all right, but they say she really carried a torch all her life.\" There was laughter in the girl\\'s eyes as she spoke. Eric had seen other eyes like that. So familiar. So beautiful. \"I am Laurie Simmons,\" the girl told him. \"My great great grandfather\\'s name was Lou Simmons. His wife was Clair. My mother has a book of hers, of poems she wrote to Eric.\" \"Tell me about them, Laurie.\" A lovely girl; as pretty as her great great grandmother. No -- prettier -- and part pf today. \"Never mind, Laurie. Just tell me about yourself.\" He knew Clair would like it this way. They wanted a world without war. The answer was simple : Stay in bed. Dreamery\\'s World By Bryce Walton somewhere down in the audoviso. Greg stred. Perspiration crawled down his face. This was it. This was the end of the nightmare. This had to be Pat Nichols. After seventytwo hours in which Greg had had to do without anesthesia! Seventy-two hours of reality ! Seventy-two hours of consciousness Consciousness. Reality. Greg didn\\'t know hpw he\\'d managed to remain sane. It seemed incredible that a man who had advanced to Stage Five in the Dream Continuity Scale, and who had been in anesthesia most of the time, could suffer \\' seventy-two hours of boring, drab, dreary and revolting reality. And still be sane. Pat Nichols was the answer. Her body faded into slim and luscious focus on the three-dim screen. Her brooding eyes and wide mouth that curled so reprovingly. She had gone psycho. Had fled from the Cowl into the dreadful Outside, seventy-two hours ago. Gone to join that fanatical group of Venusian Colonists, those outlaw schizoids who planned to start over  on Venus. \"Pat!\" Greg\\'s hand reached as though she weren\\'t just a three-dim image. \"Listen, Pat! Thank the Codes, you haven\\'t blasted yet. I\\'vebeen crazy, waiting for this call. Pat, I can\\'t even go into integrated anesthesia without you around. My dreams don\\'t seem to focus right.\" \"That\\'s too bad, Greg,\" she said. He moistened his lips slowly. He slid his hand toward the warning button beneath the table. Her eyes  didn\\'t notice, never left his face. Accusative, sad eyCs. He felt sick. He pushed the button; Now! Now Drakeson up on the apartment roof would trace the point of her call. He\\'d chart her location with the rhodium tracker niy: Thi beams. Then the two of them would go and pick Pat up and prevent that insane, suicidal, one-way trip to Venus. She might consider it a very unfair thing, but then she was psycho. She\\'d be glad of it, after she was brought back, brainprobed, and reconditioned. The thought made Greg even more ill. Brain-probing and re-conditioning involved months of a kind of mental agony that no one could adequately describe. The words were enough to give anesthetic nightmares to any Citizen, But, it was for the good of the Cowls, and of the psychos. Her voice was sad too, like her eyes. \\'T was hoping you would join me, Greg. Anyway, I called to tell you that in about five hours, we\\'re blasting. This is gOodby.\" He said something. Anything. Keep her talking, listening. Give Drakeson a chance to employ the rhodium tracker, and spot her location. A kind of panic got loose ill Greg\\'s brain. \"Pat, don\\'t you have any insight at all? Can\\'t you see that this  is advanced psychosis, that -- \" She interrupted. \"I\\'ve tried to explain to you before, Greg. But you\\'ve always preferred anesthesia. You loathe reality. But I\\'m part of reality.\" Yes. He had drearns. The anesthetic cubicles. Stage Five where a man was master of thalamic introjection, dream imagery. A stage where any part of reality Was supposed to have faded into utter inconsequence. But Pat Nichols had always been a part of his conditioned personality pattern. By taking her out of k, fate had struck him with an unbalance in psyche that disturbed the sole objective of life -- to dream \"But that\\'s a suicide trip, Pat, and you\\'ll never have a chance to bd cured of your schizophrenia, even if you do get to Venus -- \" Her interruption had weariness in it. \"Goodby, Greg. I\\'m sorry for you. That silly status quo, ancf futile dreaming. It will never let you realize what a fine man you are. You\\'ll decay and die in some futile image. So goodby, Greg. And good dreaming.\" She was gone from the screen. Maybe from earth, unless he got out there and stopped her before that suicide ship rocketed out from its hidden subterranean blast tube. G reg hurried. He didn\\'t realize he could function so rapidly in the world of physical reality. In seconds he had zipped thin resiliant aerosilk about his body, and was running across the wide plastic mesh roof toward the heliocruiser in which Drakeson was waiting. Greg felt the physical power flow as he ran. It sickened him. The conditioners kept the body in good shape, but only to allow the cortical-thalamic imagery faculties to function better. Actual physical business like this was revolting to any Cowl citizen. Any sort of physical and materialistic activity, divorced from anesthesia, might be a sign of enroaching psychosis. That was the fear. That fear of psychosis that might lead to vklence. To change. The Cowls over the Cities protected them from any physical interference with an absolutely stabile, unchanging and static culture. But the Cowls hadn\\'t been able to protect the Citizenry from insanity. During the past year, psychosis had been striking increasingly, without warning, indiscriminate\\'yGreg dropped down beside the thin ascetic figure at the controls. He grabbed Drakeson\\'s arm. \"Did you pick it up, Drake?\" \"Uh-huh,\" Drakeson drawled. His mouth was cynical, his gray eyes somber. \"Traced it down to a ten meter radius, ,but it\\'s underground. About five miles out of Old Washington, just inside the big radioactivated forest east of the Ruins. About half an hour\\'s flight as the crow might fly. If there was a crow left.\" \"Then let\\'s go. Lift this gadget out of here!\" A spot of nausea bounced into Greg\\'s stomach at Drakeson\\'s reference to what the big Chain blowup had done to almost all high cellular life forms, including crows. Only insects and a few shielded humans had withstood the radiation. Most high complex cellular organisms had paid for their complexity. But thanks to the establishment of the Cowled Cities and the Codes of non-change, non-violence, they wouldn\\'t have to pay again. No chance for social change now that might lead to another such disaster. If they could only trace the cause for this psychosis epidemic -- Greg hadn\\'t , thought about it at all until Pat had started talking peculiarly, then when she had broken up completely and left the Cowl, then it hadhit home, hard. The heliocruiser lifted slowly under Drakeson\\'s awkward guidance. Only the Controllers, the Control Council Guards, could work the gadgetry of the City with practiced ease. Everybody else, naturally, was conditioned to various anesthesia states, and had no reason to deal with materialistic things. The cruiser lifted until it was flying directly beneath the opaque stuff of the Cowl, lost in the dazzling rainbows of sunlight shattering through. Drakeson said. \"We\\'ll keep up here. Maybe the Controllers won\\'t see us.\" \"What?\" A peculiar coolness slid along Greg\\'s spine. \"Maybe they won\\'t see us,\" repeated Drakeson, and then he smiled wryly. \"Listen, Greg, You\\'re way ahead of me in the Dream Continuity. You\\'re a lot further away from reality than I am. More impractical. So listen to a word or two before we try to break through the Cowl. \"We\\'ve never been Outside, don\\'t forget that. It\\'s dangerous. You haven\\'t considered any of the angles. For example, I picked up a couple of shielding suits which you hadn\\'t thought of. And two small wrist Geigers. If I hadn\\'t thought of them, then we\\'d probably have been contaminated with hard radiation out there, and would have been thrown into the septic pools for about six months.\" Greg shivered. That would have been very bad. \"It\\'s deadly out there; poisonous. Greg. Only the insane have wanted to go Outside for the last few years, and only the Controllers have been out and then only to try to track down the hiding places of the Colonists. You hadn\\'t considered that, but I did. So I had to steal a cOuple of heat-blasters  from the Museum...\" \"You what?\" Greg stared at the two deadly coiled weapons Drakeson dragged from beneath the seat. \"Do the Controllers know?\" \"They\\'ve probably found out by now, or will very soon,\" Drakeson looked grim. \"They\\'ll be after us with sky-cars and para-guns. Andthey\\'re sure to slap a psycho label on lis. They would anyway, probably, for just going Outside. But having destructive forbidden weapons on us, they\\'re sure to, and we couldn\\'t go Outside without weapons, Greg.\" That was right, Greg knew. Paralysis guns wouldn\\'t have been enough out there. Drakeson said softly : \"Is she worth it, Greg? We may have to be brain-probed. Is she worth that kind of pain?\" G reg\\'S stomach seemed to tie up in knots. Brain-probing, psychometry. Greg whispered hoarsely. \"She\\'s worth it, Drake. And besides, it\\'s ridiculous to think that we\\'ll be suspected. I\\'m only interested in preventing Pat from making that suicide trip. The Controllers have the same interest.\" \"But that\\'s their job. You and I aren\\'t supposed to be concerned with reality. They\\'ve gotten very sensitive this last year. They can\\'t take any chances. At the least sign of disintegration, they have to apprehend and send you to psychometry.\" Greg said. \"You trying to get out of your bargain, Drake? If you don\\'t want that carton of Stage Five dream capsules, then -- \" \"Oh no, I\\'ll take a chance to get that carton. I never thought I\\'d get a chance to experience such prematmre dreams. It\\'s worth the gamble, we might get away without being probed.\" Greg\\'s head ached. Reality always gave him a headache. He wasn\\'t used to it. A man who had reached Stage Five had been an anesthesiac too long to find reality comfortable. \"I know the Codes,\" Greg whispered. \"Legally, there\\'s no reason to be apprehended just for leaving the Cowl. And as for the blasters, well -- we can drop them off, hide them, if the Controllers get after us.\" The cruiser  moved down the sloping arc of tlie Cowl toward the dark patch that Greg recognized as a merging chamber. The plastic spires of the City reached up around them as though reaching for the sun. Only a few human figures could be seen far below, on roofs, and in the streets. A few low stage humans not in anesthesia. Greg crawled into the shielding suit. He took over the unfamiliar controls while Drakeson got his own shielding suit on. They weren\\'t heavy, but were sluggish material that could throw off ordinary radiation. Behind him Greg heard Drakeson\\'s harsh yell. \"Sky-cars! Ten of them! Shooting up out of the Control Tower and coming right toward usl Merge, and merge fast, Greg, if you still want to go Outside.\" Inside the thick sheeting of the suit, Greg\\'s skin was soaked with perspiration. His face, was strained as he moved the cruiser into the first lock chamber. The cruiser had to move through a series of locks to the Outside. A precaution to keep bacteria, radiation, other inimical elements from coming in while an exit from the Cowl was being made. One by one the locks opened and closed as grav-hooks pulled the cruiser through. It was a precariously balanced culture, this one inside the Cowls, Greg thought. Like living inside a gigantic sealed testtube. Any slightly alien elements introduced into that test-tube could make it a place of sealed death in a short time. A rigidly controlled, non-changing environment. That was fine, except that some humans within it had a habit of changing, ancfor the worse. Retrogression, psychosis. Psychometry was trying franticaL ly to find the cause. It seemed obvious that the Venusian Colonists might be causing psychotics to appear in order to swell their ranks of volunteers to go to Venus to start a \"new dynamic, progressive order.\" Madness. Suicide. Progressive evolutionary philosophies meant change, and change might lead anywhere. But eventually it could only lead to another horrible Chain, One Chain had been enough. The earth had been thoroughly wrecked. The few survivors had set up the anti-reality standards, the Cowls and the Codes -- and the Controllers. They established the Dream Continuity that led to the various anesthetic stages. But people went insane. They disagreed. They fled the Cowls. Venusian Colonial Enterprises resulted. It was organized insanity. A neatly planned psychosis, with grandiose delusions of justification. They would save humanity ! Madness. Schizophrenia. Venusian Colonization had been organized three years before. At least four known spaceships had been constructed, stocked, and blasted. They changed their subterranean hideouts after each blast. It had just never occurred to Greg that Pat could go psycho and join them. It was even more ridiculous for the Controllers to suspect him of being psycho. He felt a little better as the cruiser broke out beyond the Cowl and into the blazing natural sun of noon. It blinded Greg. Frightened him a little. He\\'d never seen the sun before, except dimmed by the Cowl. He sent the cruiser climbing rapidly above the weird grotesque terrain. Drakeson jumped into the seat beside him. His face was white. \"Open the converter feed valvfes wide, Greg! Clear open! The Control cars aren\\'t stopping at the merger. They\\'re coming on through. They\\'re right behind us.\" Greg looked back. Ten sky-cars, and within neuro-gun range. He jerked the converter wide open. Acceleration slammed him back hard. He knew now what fear was. In dreams you never suffered it. T he audio in the control panel cracked out. \"Dalson! Drakeson! Turn around! Re-enter the Cowl. Return immediately. This is a Control Council order. Do so or we fire with full charge neuro-blasts.\" Paralysis guns. And full blast. Greg swallowed. They meant business. And without even a formal enquiry! Drakeson said in a whisper. \"What are we going to do?\" Greg didn\\'t know. How could they think he was psycho? Drakeson licked his lips. \"I don\\'t want to go under the brain-probers, Greg. Nobody does. I don\\'t want to be re-conditioned. I want to stay like I am. I\\'m not psycho. And they\\'ll brain-probe us sure if we don\\'t turn around and go back. And even if we do -- The audio\\'s cold impersonal voice said: \"This is the last order. The neuro-guns are ready to fire.\" Greg\\'s mind ran in mad circles. He tried to think. He felt Drakeson move, and then he saw Drakeson\\'s hand with that infernal injection solution jiggling arbund in a big hypodermic syringe. \"I\\'ve just given myself another shot, Greg. You\\'d better have another right now. If we land down there we\\'ll need all the adrenolex we can get.\" Greg hardly felt the injection as he tried tb think, clarify his situation. I\\'m not psycho, he thought desperately. I\\'m doing something a little bit different, but it isn\\'t psychosis. But good integrated citizens would not fight against the orders from Control. All right. He would submit to brain-probing. But he\\'d get Pat out of that trap she was in first. He might be able to talk her out of it if he could get to her personally, be with her a while. The Controllers certainly couldn\\'t. They\\'d drive her away into space as soon as she saw them. The solution. A legality. He knew the Codes didn\\'t he? He yelled back at the pursuing sky-cars via the audio: \"Don\\'t fire those neuro-guns. This is Greg Dalson speaking. There\\'s a law against any aggressive destructive action on the part of any Citizen.\" The audio replied. \"The neuroguns aren\\'t destructive. Temporary paralysis.\" Greg said. \"This cruiser is at a high altitude and traveling fast. If you paralyze us now, the cruiser will crash. By using the neuro-guns on us, you will be destructive, homicidal.\" A dead silence greeted this statement. Greg went on. \"I\\'m a Stage Five citizen. Legally, there\\'s no restriction against going outside the Cowl. I\\'ll report your action and attitudes to the Council if you fire those neuro-guns.\" Drakeson choked something unintelligible. His face was deathly pale. \"Clever,\" he whispered. \"But that clinches it. When we do go back, it\\'s psychometry for us, Greg,\" Finally the audio answered. The voice was not so cold. It had a tinge of emotionalism. It said. \"A technicality, but it does prevent us from firing the neuro-guns. However, we feel it our duty to remain with you until you do return to the Cowl. Because of the recent epidemic of psychosis, we find this authorized by the Control Council... Greg savagely flipped off the audio. Drakesbn said. \"If they stay on our toil, we\\'ll lead them right to Pat. They\\'ll scare her away before you get a chance to talk with her, and try to prevent her from going on the ship.\" \"I know,\" Greg said. \"I know. We\\'ve got to figure something -- \" He looked down at the fantastic semi-organic flora below, \"How far to go yet, Drake?\" \"About three minutes.\" \"All right. We\\'ll set the cruiser down here, and walk to where Pat is.\" Drakeson choked. \"That\\'s suicide,\" he said. \"We won\\'t have a chance.\" G reg didn\\'t have time to be surprised at his own actions. He pulled Drakeson\\'s hands away from the controls. Drakeson was trying to stop him from bringing the cruiser down. Drakeson gasped. \"Even with the heat-blasters, we\\'ll never get a hundred meters away from where we land. I figured on landing directly over the place -- \" \"So will the Controllers\" Greg said. He hurled Drakeson back, heard him sprawl on the mesh flooring where he lay, half sobbing. Greg angled the ship down abruptly. \"As soon as we land, I\\'m running for it,\" he called back. \"The Controllers will be down there swarming all over us, and I don\\'t want to lead them to where Pat is.\" Drakeson crawled oyer to the bunk and sat on it. \"All right,\" he said. \"I\\'m with you. It\\'s too late to get out of it now. For a carton of premature dreams, I\\'ve gotten myself stuck with a psycho tag. I\\'m stuck with it anyway, now. Might as well go on, and stay out of the brain-probers as long as possible.\" Greg felt a tingling crawl up his wrists as they dropped down above the gigantic, semi-organic forest. Mutated cells in the process of change had played havoc with the preChain life forms. According to what little he had gotten from infotapes, there was no longer any distinction or at least very little, between organic and inorganic life, outside the Cowls. Psycho. He\\'d still argue with Drakeson about that, but lie didn\\'t have time. He wasn\\'t psycho. As soon as he persuaded Pat to abandon the flight, they\\'d give themselves up, return to the Cowl, and things would return to normal, to anesthesia, Stage Five, then Six, then Seven, on to the final eternal dream. That\\'s the way it was going to be. And if they had to suffer the hells of brainprobing and the awful ego-loss of re-conditioning, then they would do that too. It was for the good of the Cowls, the preserva tion of the Codes. A noble sacrifice. Must be no change. No menace to stability. Any suggestion of change made ohe suspect; Greg\\'s eyes misted as he brought the cruiser to a halfcrash landing. Even as he tried to bring his blurred vision into focus, he was running to the exit. He had the sliding paneh open. He was up to his knees in writhing tendrils. He was running through a crimson twilight. Behind him, he heard Drakeson tearing through the tendrils, and clutching vines. Overhead he could hear the drone of the sky-car\\'s atomurbinic motors. Whether they would land and continue the search on foot through the deadly forest, Greg couldn\\'t know. , He didn\\'t know anything about the Controllers\\' methods. \"How far, Drake,\" he yelled through the interperson audio. Drakeson came running up beside Greg. Severed strings of torri, still living life-stuff writhed from his shoulders and legs. \\'T\\'d say about half a mile straight ahead. That\\'s a long way through this nightmare.\" Greg screamed. A broad mushroom-like growth had opened a mouth. A gigantic, sickeningly gray mouth full of deadly, flesh-eating acid. A flower-bright vine with great tensile strength raked Drakeson in toward that gaping maw. Drakeson\\' s arms were held tight against his sides. He was straining --  helpless. Through the glassine mask of his helmet, Greg saw Drakeson\\' s face turning red with constriction. His voice came to Greg in a burst of fear. \"The gun, Greg! The heatblaster -- quick -- \" Greg leaned forward, staring in rigid fascination. Fleshy stocks swayed toward him. Other mouths opened, petal mouths. Gigantic floral traps, and cannibal blooms. \"Greg! Greg!\" Drakeson was framed now by that great cannibal maw. Greg had the heat-blaster up. He had it leveled. But he couldn\\'t depress the firing stud. \"Drake! I can\\'t! I can\\'t!\" How could any integrated man be deliberately destructive? How could any sane person -- kill? \"I can\\'t -- Drake -- \" The awful conflict seemed to rip through his body. He felt the sweat, hot and profuse, rolling down his face. He concentrated on that gun, on his finger, on the firing stud. The cannibal blossom was closing. Sticky juices dripped over Drakeson. He was screaming. Greg\\'s finger lifted. He could not fire. The Codes said no destruction. established after the great Chain disaster. Violence begets violence, the Codes said. And once begun, it was accumulative, like the snowball rolling down hill. Greg sagged. His knees buckled. He sprawled out in the slippery muck. Tendrils swished softly and hungrily around him. He heard a shout. He tried to twist his head. Figures blurred before his eyes, and he heard the deadly chehoivwwThe last thing he remembered before the dark wrapped him up softly and warmly, was the cannibal ments of stringy tissue, and Drakeson falling free. I didnt fire, he was thinking. Someone else saved Drakeson. But I think I might have done it. My finger -- it was moving -- bending -- or was it? No. I couldn\\'t have been destructive. Couldn\\'t have killed. to Greg. Painfully. It carrie back slowly and it took a long time. He lifted his eyelids. He raised himself to a sitting position. He stared down a gloOmy, phosphorescent corridor. It was obviously subterranean. It was damp, chill. Cold luciferin light glowed from lichen on walls and low ragged ceiling. It was long and it finally curved, he decided. But he could look back into a long slow curve of corridor and ahead into the same. Here and there, the mouths of branch corridors came in. He looked at his hand. It Still clutched the butt of the heatblaster. He felt strange. The surroundings were very real, yet they seemed somehow not real. The shock of trying to fire that blaster when the sanity in him shrieked \"No!\" had been too much foishim. The shock had blanked him out. He breathed a deep sigh of temporary relief and triumph. He hadn\\'t killed He thought of Drake- son. Somebody had saved him. Someone had Mled. Not the Controllers. They could employ only the neuro-guns to paralyze. So he decided that Colonists had probably saved Drakeson. Terror gripped Greg then He remembered Drakeson yelling at\" him, the distended eyes, the straining face. And how he himself had almost given in, had almost killed. Had almost gone psycho. But he hadn\\'t. That was the important thing. He was still a sane, integrated part of the Cowls and the Codes. And after a test like thatj he figured that nothing could break him. Let them send him to psych ome try. Let them clamp on the brain-probers and leave them on for months. They\\'d not find any psycho tendencies in Greg Dalson. Greg tried to reason. But he had no place, no fodation, for a beginning. He didn\\'t knoV where he  was, cyr why he had been left here. He knew that someone, the Colonists probably, had saved Drakeson from that plant thing. Some mental pressure had blacked him out, he thought, and then what? He didn\\'t know. Which way? It didn\\'t seem to matter. He started walking. He was bone-weary. His head throbbed. His eyes burned. And he Was afraid. He had gotten himself into a completely un-Codified situation. He was lost, helpless, outside the protection of the Cowls, the Codes, and anesthesia. He was surrounded by reality. Reality in all its essential horror. Conflict, Physical danger...Uncertainties. Materialistic barriers. All the old shibboleths that the Cowls and the Codes and the anesthesiac dreams had protected him from. And all because of Pat Nichols. But he\\'d stood a big test. And he\\'d won. He hadn\\'t killed. He wasn\\'t destructive. He -- The cry touched his ears and died. It was too violent and filled with pain and terror to \\'make any definite impression the first time. He crouched. His eyes distended. The scream came again, and this time it chopped through him. Mis nerves seemed to shrivel and curl beneath the repeated onslaughts of the screams. Then he was running. He didn\\'t know why, except that he had to run. He ran with fearful, gasping desperation. But he didn\\'t know why. H e ran past the mouth opening into the main corridor. Then came back and ran into the darker, strangely-lighted artery. He ran harder. And yet he wasn\\'t running. Not all of him. As he ran, he was conscious of some undefinable, but terrific conflict. Beneath the suit, his skin burned with sweat. He felt the rigid pattern of tensed neck and jaw muscles. I dont feel at all familiar. Some things very wrong. Everything\\'s wrong. Fm displaced, like something that has slipped into an alien dimension. He stopped, quickly. His heart seemed to swell, burst with terror. Terror and something else. The something else came, and with it came horror of itself. The emotion, and then horror of the emotion. He stood shivering, his teeth clacking like an ancient abacus. \\'Tat!\" He screamed her name. The cry pounded back into his ears inside the helmet. This wasn\\'t DrakescJn. This was Pat. Pat was going to die now. Not Drakeson. The walls were -- alive. They were not like the walls of the corridors. This was a circular chamber, and the walls were sagging and undulating like part of a giant\\'s flesh. He heard heavy sluggish sounds. Masses of the gray viscous stuff sagged, changed form, remolded itself into monstrous shapes. Patl Only her face and part of her upper body were visible now. The shielding of her suit had been cracked wide open by pressure as the semi-organic thing, whatever it was, had closed around her.  The walls rushed in as Greg stumbled drunkenly. The ceiling sagged lower. Long knobs fell, like globules of paste, then lengthened into shapeless tendrils that snapped out at Greg. He fell back. Pat\\'s screarh penetrated again. No beauty remained in her face now. Her eyes were sick. Her lips were loose and trembling. \"Greg -- help me -- help me -- see what it does -- the others -- \" He saw the others then. Maybe he hadn\\'t noticed before, because his mind didn\\'t want him to see. Husks. Pallid wrinkled husks, sucked dry and shriveled. Several figures not recognizable anymore, hardly recognizable as human. Just vaguely human, broken, sucked dry. His mind seemed covered by a grotesque shadow. His flesh crawled and his throat turned dry, and perspiration made a stream down his throat. He felt his eyes looking down at his right hand. It held the heat-blaster. The skin felt tight as though it would split as he gripped the heavy butt of the coiled weapon. He concentrated on the finger that was frozen on the firing stud. If he could destroy, then he was insane. His experience with Drakeson, that had been no test at all compared with this. This was Pat. Pat, and she was dying -- dying unspeakably. This was the great test of his sanity. He. concentrated on the finger. He must keep it frozen. He must back out of here. Get away, get back to the Cowl, back to anesthesia and sleep. The finger raised slowly from the stud. His feet lifted as his body moved fitfully back, back back -- \"Greg-help me, Greg -- Her eyes stopped him. They tumbled into terrible clarity. She whispered starkly. \"Greg -- help me -- kill it, Gtegi For me -- Kill it.\" He felt his lips part in a great and terrible cry of torture. His shoulders began to twitch slightly. His arms and fingers took up the jerky rhythm. Horror and a violent crimson flood of unfamiliar emotions mushroomed like a volcano of madness. Something began crumbling away. He lurched forward. He felt the heat-blaster heaving, throwing out its. deadly load. The gun had weight and power in his hand as he crouched lower and moved in. The power load swathed in long slicing arcs. Steam and sickening stench fell around him. He moved in. He stumbled forward kicking out to right and left at the quivering slices #f stuff that were falling around him. Destruction, Kill. Death. This was all three, and in a giant, almost inconceivable quantity. Her face through the steaming cloud. Her throat moving as she swallowed. Brightness, the brightness of disbelief and irripossibility coming into her eyes. He kept moving in until the monstrous mutated gray thing was thoroughly dead. Until every separate tendril and patch was blasted to smoke. Then he lifted her broken body in his arms. Tears fell on the opaqueness of his helmet. \"I\\'m sorry, Pat\\' he choked. \"I\\'m sorry it didn\\'t happen sooner. I\\'m sorry I waited too long -- but it isn\\'t easy -- to let yourself go insane.\" Something was wrong.\\' Pat! Pat! She seemed to be fading away from him, drifting away, melting into tattered veils of cloud. Her face became only two bright glad eyes, then they also melted together into a radiant pool. He toppled into the pool. He sank down, a wonderful lifelessness spreading through him. He closed his eyes. Something was beginning to be very funny. In the thickening dark, he laughed a little. And in that laugh was a crazy, climbing note of -- triumph. H e opened his eyes. He Was laughing, in a kind of soft hysteria. He was on a couch. Not a a dream couch, but just a plain hard bed. He sat up stiffly. Pain tingled down his legs. He saw Pat Nichols. And another. A man. He remembered him vaguely, one of the first who had escaped from the Cowl. His name -- yes -- he remembered now, MerroL Pat Nichols, alive, and smiling. Very beautiful too in a brief aerosilk bra and shorts and sandals. Her hair was a dark lovely cloud flowing down over bare shoulders. \"Hello, Greg,\" she said softly. \"Welcome to -- the Colonists.\" \"What?\" He swung his legs around. \"I don\\'t understand. Not entirely.\" Merrol a gaunt elderly man nodded from behind a desk. Merrol\\'s hair was gray and sparse. Strange, seeing a man who showed age. Within the Cowls, one never grew physically old, Pat said, \"This is Ralph Merrol, Personnel Director of Venusian Colonization Enterprises.\" Greg\\'s numbness was filtering away beneath Pat\\'s warm glad eyes. He raised his hand. The heatblaster was still gripped in his fingers. It evidently hadn\\'t been fired. \"It was all illusion,\" he said. \"The scene in the cavern. It never happened?\" Merrol\\'s care-lined face nodded. \"It happened, but in your mind, Greg. We rescued you and Drakeson from the cannibal plant. We brought you here. You had lost consciousness. We put you under the hypnosene rays, and put you through an experience that was quite real to you. We proved something to ourselves, and to you. Greg -- you\\'re sane now.\" Greg tried to understand. The thing didn\\'t make sense yet, but the glimmerings of the truth were beginning to solidify in his aching brain. \"Sane? But I killed. I wanted to kill. I wanted to destroy, and I did. That\\'s hardly the actions of a -- sane man.\" Merrol smiled thinly. \"Fromour point of view it is, Greg. We consider ourselves sane. We consider the Cowled Cities, and the Codes insane. It\\'s relative I supposed, but I think we can convince you, if we haven\\'t already.\" Greg looked at Pat. She smiled. He smiled back. \"Justified or not,\" he whispered. \"I\\'m here. Sane or insane, I\\'m one of the Colonists now I guess. Unless I want to return to the Cowls, be probed and te-conditioned.\" Pat whispered. \"Do you, Greg?\" He shook his head. \"Not now. Tm tired. I don\\'t want to now. Maybe I never will. All I want now, is rest.\" Merrol leaned across the desk. \"Before you rest, you\\'d better get a few things straight, Greg. We want you to be convinced that you\\'re doing the right thing. We feel that the big Chain blowup shocked the whole human race into a mass psychosis, comparable to individual cases of hysteria, schizophrenia, escape from reality. That\\'s why the non-change, non-aggressiveness Codes were established. Also, the anesthesia, the Dream Continuity Scale -- nothing but hysteria on a mass and planned basis,\" Merrol got up. He walked around and sat down beside Greg. \"Carried out to its inevitable end, this could only lead to mass racial suicide. That\\'s obvious. It was a static dead end. A few people recovered from the psychosis. They escaped, and formed the Colonists. But their own welfare wasn\\'t the most important thing. \"They concerned themselves then with the freeing of the Citizens of the Cowls from their psychosis. The world is untenable on a large scale now, due to radioactive poisoning. It will remain untenable for some time. Meanwhile we decided to Colonize Venus. We\\' ve established Colonies there. Thriving communities, but the important thing is thk Greg -- it\\'s given new impetus and enthusiasm to those who become sane and escape the Cowls. It presents a big challenge and solidifies the cure. \\' \\'Tt\\'s bigger than Control has any idea that it is. It will take a long time yet, but we\\'ll win. You have noticed the increase in so-called insanity in the Cowls. It really means just the opposite. Our numbers are increasing by leaps and bounds.\\' Greg said. \"The Controllers think you\\'re using some psychological or physical pressure to create these -- Cures.\" Merrol smiled. \"We\\'ve got a recruiting system, Drakeson, for example, is a spy. We have spies all over the Cowls.\" Greg stared. \"Drakeson?\" A door opened. The lean cynical tnan entered, nodded, and stood beside Pat. His eyes shone more brightly as he looked at Greg. \"That\\'s right,\" Drakeson said. \"Remember the two injections. I said they were adrenolex. They weren\\'t. Our spies inside the Cowls are equipped with a supply of a certain aggression factor. It used to be called Kappa, or K, for killer. This factor is handed down through the generations in the general cell protoplasm. It forces aggressive tendencies. It makes a man capable of physical aggressive action, and able to kill, if he has to. High motivation is required though, in most cases. With you, my probable death wasn\\'t enough. It took the vision of Pat here in the dutches of a monster to make the Kappa factor work on yoti, Greg.\" Greg rubbed his eyes. Pat came over and he took her hand, held it tightly. A svatinth came out of her and into him, into his mind. D rakeson went on. \\'We isolated the Kappa factor, made it into solution. We all have it, even the anesthetic citizens of the Cowls, but the mass shock psychosis won\\'t let it work. However, a Strong over load of Kappa injection will sometimes break the psychosis, force the; person back into an aggressive personality, capable of destruction. Each individual carries an armament of between # and # particles of the Kappa factor after we give an injection. It took # parr tides to break your suicidal hysteria.\" Pat squeezed his hand. Greg looked up. He grinned with a kind of glad embarrassment. \"I don\\'t know yet whether to thank you or not. Frankly though, I do feel better.\" He thought of the Cowls. Testttibes, glass cages, and dreams that led finally to the final anesthesia, death. He shuddered, and tried tb push the memory out of his mind. It seemed unhealthy now. Uncleah and -- yes, it did seem insane He raised his eyes to the ceiling. He saw the self-inverting three dimensional mechanism that had given him that starkly real adventure in which he had been able to kill, for Pat. A dream sequence, partly hypnotic, partly created by cathode image activating the multiphase AC. A high harmonic of multi-phase AG field hanging over him, and a focusing radiator. Dream. Nightmare. He looked at Pat. \"I think I\\'D take reality now,\" he said softly. He felt the pull on his arm, and he got up. She led him through a door and into a soft twilight. He held her tightly against him. She whispered. \"The ship\\'s waiting for us, Greg. The next ship. You\\'re already on the passenger list. You see, I knew you\\'d come with us. I was hoping so desperately, J couldn\\'t think any differently.\" He kissed her. He held her more tightly as though -- as though -- He felt her warm muscles tense against him. Her eyes widened. \"Greg! What is it?\" He shook his head. \"I -- I got to wondering if this too, might not be just a dream. I\\'ve been in anesthesia too long maybe. How can I know what\\'s real and what isn\\'t real?\" He felt her warm moist fingers on the back of his neck. He felt her lift on her toes, pull his face down. She kissed him. Her voice was husky, and her breath was warm on his lips. \"Do you know now, Greg? Is this a dream?\" He shook his head. His voice was hoarse. \"No -- no -- this isn\\'t a dream.\" She laughed softly. They moved away, down the corpidor toward the ship. His story reads like fantasy -- yet Science has never disproved it! A t the age of ten he caused his bowl of oatmeal to skip about the breakfast table, and furniture to be lifted by unseen hands. At thirteen he was prophesying events, even death, with alarming accuracy. At twentyfive he was holding spellbound men -- scholars, emperors, scientists, critics -- whose names ring in the pages of history! Daniel Home was probably the greatest medium the modern world has ever known. His feats were more than amazing -- they were supernatural. Witnesses could hardly believe their eyes, yet they had to -- for no one could ever refute him! ing story of this great American-reared medium in the May issue of -- On sale at all newsstands -- # cents The Reamer mansion was on trial. It announced its own verdict -- guilty! Pattern By Alvin Heiner H e WAS a man easily smiled at; a little birdlike individual carrying an umbrella and wearing upon his pink face a look remindful of happy secrets about to be revealed. He canae to my desk during the midafternoon lull and said, \"I am Professor Jonathan Waits. I have come to avail myself of your facilities.\" I had never heard it put quite that way before, but from Professor Waits, it did not sound stilted. It was the way you would expect him to put it. He beamed at the ceiling and said, \"What # fine old library, my dear. I must bring Nicholas Some time.\" I gave him the smile reserved financial supporters and unknown quanta tivcs and asked, \"Could I be of service?\" He didn\\'t get to it immediately, understand this library is fairly crammed with old recordsdata on the historical aspects of this area. Personal histories and such.\" He had a way of radiating his own cheerful mood. \"Oh yes,\" I assured him. \"It\\'s an exceptional day when we don\\'t sweep a D.A.R. or two out of the aisles come closing time.\" This, according to his laugh, wai quite good. He said, \"I\\'m sure we\\'ll get on splendidly, Miss -- ?\" Hopstead.\"  \"Are you a native?\" \"A New Englander from way back,\" I assured him. \"Some of my ancestors used to drink buttered rum with Captain Rogers.\" \"Then possibly you\\'d Ukq to know about my work.\" \"I certainly would.\" And, strangely enough, I did. \"I am a researcher into the -- well, the unusu.\" \"Psychic research?\" I inquired, wanting him to know we New Englanders were not dullards. \"No. Nothing to do with the supernatural at all. My work is to prove that all occurrences, however mysterious, are the logical result of previous actions of individuals ; that superstitions are the result, not so much of ignorance, but lack of knowledge.\" While I wrestled with that one, he said, \"Maybe I could be a trifle more explicit.\" \"That would help.\" His bright little eyes got even brighter. \"Do you know, by chance, of the Reamer mansion over in Carleton?\" I certainly did. It was some thirty miles from Patterson, but as a child, Pd visited the place. All children within the radius had visited the Reamer mansion at least once. It was an ancient fifteen room cockroach trap with such a history of death and violence behind it as to cause the kids to walk on tiptoe through its silent rooms. I told the professor I knew about it. \"It has been vacant for fifteen years,\" he observed. \"And will be vacant for twice fifteen more, T imagine.\" \"That\\'s just the point. Superstition. Otherwise solid and sane people wouldn\\'t dream of moving into the Reamer mansion. And it\\'s so silly.\" \"It is?\" \"Of course. And that\\'s why I\\'m here. I intend to prove, so the most stubborn will understand, that the house itself has nothing whatsoever to do with its own grim past ; that the people who lived in it are to blame.\" It was a dull day and he was such an apparently sincere little man that I decided to keep the conversation alive. \"Fm afraid you\\'ll have, a hard time proving it. Let\\'s see -- the first one was old Silas Reamer. He committed suicide there. That was sometime . around #. Then -- \" \" -- His son, Heriry Reamer, was found dead under mysterious circumstances two years later. Murder was obvious, but nothing has ever been done about it.\" I frowned in mock severity. \"I don\\'t like the way you put that, Professor. Do you imply that we New Englanders condone violence?\" \"Oh, not at all. There were just -- no clues, from what I\\'ve learned. The next unfortunate, a renter named Miles McCormick, was found dead along with his wife and child as a result of lethal gas from a faulty stove.\" \"That happened the year I was born. We have the old newspapers here, telling about it.\" \"Those reports, along with other material are what I wish to study,\" Professor Waits said, then went on. \"The house stood vacant for five years, until a Johnathan Hays bought it.\" \"But Johnathan Hays never moved in. He died of a heart attack while carrying a chair through the front door.\" He beamed on me. \"You are a remarkably alert young woman; well up in local history.\" \"With no credit to me. You\\'d be hard put finding a citizen around here who doesn\\'t know the history of the Reamer mansion.\" \"Not \\'of tlje Reamer mansion\\', my dear. Of the people who just happened to reap their ill-fortune there\\' \"You insist the house had noth ing to do with it?\" \"Nothing whatever.\" I you know how big a bite you\\'ve taken? If you go up in the hills hereabouts you\\'ll find whole families living in dirt-floor houses You\\'ll find children who never heard of a bath or a telephone. But you won\\'t find one person who would live in the Reamer mansion for a salary paid promptly every Saturday morning.\" \"Nonetheless,\" Professor Waits replied, \"the so-called jinx of the mansion, or any other maligned locality, is a matter of monstrous coincidence. The truth lies hidden in the lives of the people involved. I\\'ve been ferreting out that truth.\" \"You mean this isn\\'t a beginning, Professor?\" He grasped his umbrella in a manner indicating he meant to spear a dragon in case there were any around, and said, \"Oh my no! I\\'ve been tracing the lives of the principals in this drama for some time. It involves long, tedious work I must not only dig into the lives of the unfortunates themselves, but also into those of kin; everi -- in some cases -- friends.\" \"What did you find out about the murder?\" He evaded neatly, \"I am not seeking a killer as such. Relative to that facet of the case, I am more interested in Henry Reamer himself. A very wise man once said, \\'If you would understand violence, look also intothe heart of the murdered\\'. A man carries the seeds of his destiny in his own soul,\" \"And you intend to prove it?\" \"I am finding more proof every day. Soon I shall publish a paper which will startle the thinking world,\" I could see the Professor wasn\\'t one to be backed into any corners \"And how can I help in this Work?\" \"I am tracing at the moment, certain details in the life of Mabel Tut worthy, an aunt of Silas Ream- er. Upauthenticated legends indicate she killed an eight-point buck once, with her bare hands, and dragged it home across ten miles of forest.\" \"I\\'ve heard that, and it\\'s probably true. You think it has something to do with what happened to Silas?\" \" -- And his son Henry.\" \"I think you\\'ll find what you want in that section by the south window. It\\'s devoted to local history.\" \"Thank you, my dear.\" He moved away, reminding tne somehow, of a happy retriever going into a lake after a duck. Halfway to the shelves, he halted suddenly and turned. \"Did you know that seventy percent of the accidents happen to twenty percent of the people?\" I didn\\'t, but I refused to admit such backwardness. \"I certainly do. Amazing, isn\\'t it?\" \"That is one of the pillars upon which my work is based.\" \"And there are others?\" \"Seven in all.\" He didn\\'t tell me what the other six were. Instead he disappeared into local history and left me with the latest best seller I was reading under the counter lest some child come in and be stripped of all innocence by one glance. It was two hours before Professor Waits reappeared. He carried a small blue notebook in one hand and a stub pencil in the other. He was positively beaming. \"A gold mine,\" he said. \"A veritable gold mine. Did you know that Ezekial worthy was gored by a bull in the year #?\" \"No -- reallyT\" Then I was truly ashamed of myself. He was such a pleasant, sincere little man and he got such fun out of life. But he misinterpreted my boorishness for true enthusiasm and said. \"It\\'s a fact! Imagine! Walking in here and finding one of the links I\\'ve hunted for months. I\\'m indebted to you, my dear, for directing me to that book shelf.\" I could have told him he was under no obligation; that I got, each week, the coolie stipend of twenty eight dollars for doing just that; but I didn\\'t want him starting an investigation into peonage system practiced in libraries and schools. Then something in the little man\\'s manner, sobered me. \"Professor -- exactly why are  you doing this?\" He blinked. \"I have plenty of money. I have the time. It interests me. And I feel it a worthy occupation; gathering knowledge through which people may know the true causes of misfortune ; may throw off the yoke of superstition.\" \"You feel, then, that nothing happens by chance?\" \"My dear,\" he said\\' solemnly, \"in this ordered universe there can be no such thing. Action and achievement-cause and result. The revealing pattern of each man\\'s actions is in the pasts of himself and his antecedents.\" \"And by proving this you will exonerate the Reamer mansion of all guilt?\" He smiled. \"You are a most intelligent young lady. Most intelligent! I shall see a great deal of you in the weeks to come.\" pect. I liked the Professor and was glad he liked me. After he left I went back and found not a single book out of place. I Hked him even more. Two weeks passed before I saw Professor Waits again. He came in out of the sunshine, carrying his black umbrella and wearing the same black string necktie. I was busy at the time, finding an acceptable book for Mrs. Winsolow\\'s little Freddie who was in bed with the pip. When I got clear, Professor Waits was deep in his research and I did not disturb him. He came pattering out just before closing time and I was struck by the somber -- almost sad -- expression he wore. \"Did you have trouble finding what you wanted, Professor?\" \"Oh no. The records are most voluminous. It\\'s just -- well, the nature of my discoveries.\" \"Bad?\\'Y \"Very bad Miss Hopstead. Do you know who Henry Reatnet\\'s murderer was?\\' \"No.\" \"Miles McCormick, the renter who died there so tragically with his family.\" I didn\\'t quite know how to respond; whether I should faint or scream for the police. I settled for a philosophical comment. \"A case of justice by a higher power.\" \"You mean McCormick\\'s death?\" \"Of course.\" \"On the contrary. There was no Gonnectioii at all between the two events. McCormick and his wife and child died because they violated a certain law, but not necessarily a law on the statute books.\" \"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t quite follow that.\" \"Look at it this way, Miss Hopstead. You are walking through a dark room. A door is standing open. You come into violent contact with the edge of it. What happens?\" \"A broken nose? A black eye.\" \"Precisely. The fact you didn\\'t know the door was there didn\\'t protect you from the consequences.\" This of course, I was forced to concede. \"Now let\\'s go a step further by taking, as example, a lower mentality than our own. A horse, knowing nothing of the laws of electricity, would step on a high Voltage wire and never know why it Was electrocuted. In such  case, the animal would violate a law it did not know existed.\" I was beginning to see what h# was driving at. \"You mean -- \" \"We are far above the horse in mentality and understanding but there are still many laws we do not understand. That is what my work involves.\" I insisted upon being heard. \"You mean a lot of apparently im nocent things we do are really electric wires.\" He beamed. \"Exactly. When we reap misfortune it is because we violate some law. Ignorance of that law doesn\\'t change the end-result one iota.\" \\'And you\\'re trying to find oUt what these -- these booby traps are?\" \"Oh I know many of them already. My paper will surprise the world. I\\'m working on a more advanced phase of the problem now. I am tracing a pattern of interlocks ing violations to show that the scene of the end-results can be only sheerest coincidence. I want to banish once and for all the superstitionstigma attached to scenes of repeated misfortune and violence.\" \"The Reamer mansion.\" \"That\\'s right. And now I must be going, Miss Hopstead.\" He gave me the departing smile and started for the door. \"Professor Waits.\" \"Yes?\" \"About Mabel Tutworthy. Did she really drag that buck ten miles.\" \"No. It was only a fawn. And she killed it less than a mile from her cabin\" \"And the murder of Henry Reamer. What proof -- ?\" \"Nothing the police would be interested in. It was the end-result of a cause they won\\'t understand until my work is published and given studyi\" He opened the door, looked around, smiled. \"This is ceiJtainly a fine old building. I must bring Nicholas with me the next time.\\' With that, he \\'was gone. to his next visit. I looked and looked and a month passed and a tall, serious-faced youth came into the library and waited until Fd finisheci checking in Mrs. Garvey\\'s returns. \\'T understand,\" he said, \"that fon have an immense store of local history in this library?\" \"The section by the south window.\" \"Thank you.\" He peered at me through thick lenses. \"Thank you Miss -- \" Hopstead.\" \"Miss Hopstead. I am Nicholas Worthy. Possibly you knew a friend of mine. Professor Waits? I am carrying on \\'his work.\" \"Carrying on -- ? Did something happen to -- ?\" \"Oh. Then you didn\\'t hear. It was most tragic. Professor Waits died of pneumonia. A great loss -- a great loss.\" I was deeply shocked. My feeling was that of losing a close friend. \"No, I hadn\\'t heard. It must have been very sudden.\" \"It was. He was advanced in years, you know, and after he fell, pneumonia set in quickly. They were unable to save him.\" \"The Professor had an accident?\" , \"Yes. He fell down the main staircase of the Reamer mansion and broke his hip.\" Latch on to the next if! pened to science-fiction in the last year is a young man named Walter Miller Jr. -- the lad who writes \"with ability lies in the fact that his stories are becoming harder and harder to acquire.

And I thought to myself, maybe this one\\'s got something new in the way of writers. But no. There they were on the cover. The same old hacks who turn out ninety percent of today\\'s science fiction. Why don\\'t you get smart and come up with some brand new names? Some writers with a fresh slant on? Science fiction is waiting for a magazine like that but it looks like you have missed the boat. This is meant as honest criticism and I hope you will print it but I\\'ll bet you won\\'t -- Janet Steiner Arent you being a little harsh, Janet.

Dear Marion:  In the letter you wrote congratulating us on the first issue of IF, you asked a question which -- strangely enough -- was not found in any other of the hundreds we received. I gathered from your letter that you are sixteen years old -- that you like science fiction but are having a tough time because your brother doesn\\'t think much of it and most of your classmates are partial to the \"true confession\" type of magazine. Possibly it will comfort you to know that I am pretty much in the same boat. My two small daughters are partial to Hopalong Cassidy, and their mother will read a science fiction story if you hold a pistol to her head. But to your question: In the straightforward manner of the typical sixteen-year-old, you ask: \"Can you give me a gooddefinition of science fiction in one sentence?\" can\\'t. As a matter of cold fact, I don\\'t know what a science fiction story is. This, no doubt, must be considered an admission of guilt, coming as it does from the editor of a science fiction magazine. But I, too, can find comfort in the conviction that I am not alone. I don\\'t think any of the other stf editors can define science fiction either. Of course I could give you any number of one-sentence definitions. I could say that a science fiction story is one in which the characters are occupied with scientific gimmicks. That wouldn\\'t be a true definition, however, because -- while it may define one type of story -- it does not define the field. Y OU see the trouble is -- science fiction is not a basic fiction pattern. Strictly speaking, there are few of these basic patterns, and they were discovered and set down long before science fiction was developed. The love story, for instance, is basic, mainly because it deals with a basic human emotion and is therefore fixed in its disciplinary structure. The detective story, which is hardly differentiated from the mystery pattern, is also basic, because we are dealing there, with a basic human characteristic -- curiosity; the love of solving a puzzle. But the western story -- as an instance -- is not really basic. It is merely a background against which love, mystery, humor, or some other basic pattern, is laid. The same is true with adventure stories, the term usually indicative of an exotic or unusual background against which a love story, a mystery story, or a problem story, is laid. As a matter of fact, even the basics can be mixed up. All detective stories -- or ninety percent of them -- carry a love interest. And all love stories carry a mystery\\' thread, even if it\\'s only the reader\\'s curiosity as to what\\'s going to happen next. So about all that can be really defined, is a story. They\\'ve discovered that in order to achieve the desired effect, a story must contain certain things. There should be both sympathetic and unsympathetic characters. The sympathetic character should be faced with a problem. He or she should solve that problem through individual effort and in a manner which satisfies and entertains the reader. a story. Of course there are a world of variations, but they\\'ve discovered that most salable fiction must shake down, in essence, to those fundamentals. And those basics are found in every good story, be it in whatever category you will. Personally, I\\'d say a science fiction story is a fantasy in which the development is based on tangible gimmicks with at least a pseudoscientific basis under them. I really feel, however, that the term denotes a background rather than a basic; just as the term western fiction is obviously a background. And I think the impossibility of really defining science fiction with any degree of accuracy, is the reason for the continuous hassle that goes on among the readers. The readership has broken up into groups, each of which has its own definition of science fiction. Probably nothing more than personal taste is behind the definitions, but that makes each group no less militant in defense of the story-type it favors. And there is no reason why each should not defend his own. The day these arguments cease is the day we can be sure science fiction interest is on the wane. So. let\\'s just say science fiction is something that can\\'t be defined but when you see it, you know it\\'s there. Sincerely, pwf. How can we possibly amount to much when our fathers were sold at auction a scant five thousand years ago ? Let My People Gd By Walter Miller, Jr. lous!\" growled Wolek Parn, glaring fixedly at the scope which displayed the planet\\'s surface as a mottled green pattern of pale luminescence. \"Look at them. Just look!\" The others said nothing. Taut faces, with eyes locked to the screen. The planet lay seven thousand miles from their landing site on its moon, but the magnification pulled the surface toward them so that they watched it as if from an altitude of thirty miles. There were continents, oceans, islands, peninsulas. The land appeared splotched and spotted, as if by variations in flora between highland and lowland. All this had been expected, predicted by Merrigull\\'s calculations. A planet for colonization, and they had reached it after thirteen years of journeying across the blackness of interstellum. Now they were here, and the planet indeed was inhabitable. Furthermore, it was already inhabited. \"There\\'s another one!\" Wolek Pam breathed as a checkerboard pattern of tiny squares drifted into view near the planet\\'s misty limb. \"Six, maybe seven miles square. That\\'s no native village!\" He turned to peer at their faces by the glow-light from the scope. Morgun Sahl, biologist -- a tall gaunt man with a saturnine face, he showed no emotion except for a flicker at the corner of his mouth that might have been indicative of bitterness or of grim amusement. A wiry shock of black hair dangled over his forehead. He was a Lincolnesque Machiavelli with a sour drawl. Beside him stood Faron Qun, chemist, mineralogist -- a shorter man with straw hair and a quiet scholarly face, small featured, slightly pudgy, usually smiling. The smile was absent now. He looked like a small boy at a funeral, and the glow of the screen made his face seem abnormally pale. He held the launch pilot\\'s arm, squeezed it spasmodically. It was a soft arm, milk-white and scattered with tiny freckles, and it belonged to Alaia Dazille -- a tall girl, not beautiful, but cool and pleasant, with red-brown hair, a narrowtival face, and hazel eyes that could shine with friendly amusement and suddenly switch to the cold glitter of sarcasm. Wolek Parn had met women that reminded him of gardenias and fine wine. Alaia Dazille, however, made him think of geraniums and buttermilk. She responded to his stare with a questioning flicker of her eyebrows. She was trying hard not to be frightened. \"Well, Alaia?\" She shook her head. \"Don\\'t ask me anything Skipper.\" He glanced at the chemist. \"Faron?\" Qun seemed to shudder. \"No opinion. Ask our biologist.\" \"All right, Sahl,\" Parn growled. \"We spent thirteen years getting here. Shall we spend another thirteen going back home?\" Morgun Sahl watched the slow drift of the checkerboard patterns on the scope. \"I\\'m sure you mean that,\" he grunted sourly. \"Maybe I do. Why shouldn\\'t I?\" The big man shrugged. \"How old would you be, Pam, when we got back? Sixty?\" \"Fifty-nine.\" \"You started in the prime of life. You get back approaching retirement age. Twenty-six years gone for nothing. And you don\\'t get paid a nickel for your trouble.\" He smiled humorlessly and tapped the scope with his finger. \"There\\'s your pay, Skipper. Epsilon Eridani Two. You won\\'t turn it down.\" Parn scowled. \"You think we can land right in the middle of somebody else\\'s civilization and start a colony?\" the corner of his mouth thoughtfully for a moment. He gestured at the screen again. \"They, whoever they are, undoubtedly know we\\'re here. The ship\\'s big enough, and the moon is close enough, so that they can see us with a small telescope. Creatures that build cities that size probably are advanced enough to spot us and recognize us for what we are: alien invaders. Undoubtedly they\\'re already reacting to what they see.\" \"And what kind of a reaction?\" The biologist shook his head. \"Impossible to guess. Anger -- hys. teria -- terror. Or maybe cold analysis and planning. I suggest we just wait and see.\" \"And wind up with a fleet of guided missiles coming up to greet us?\" \"Maybe.\" \"What kind of creatures do you think we\\'d find on such a planet?\" The biologist was slow to answer. \"Well, life always takes about the same pattern everywhere we\\'ve found it. It\\'s never been too radically different. The basic protoplasm is always the same, or we can\\'t call it \\'life.\\' This planet is very earthlike. The sun is cooler than our Sol, but there\\'s enough ultraviolet for vegetation. I believe the life-forms will be similar to what Earth has developed at various periods in her history.\" \"Which might be anything from a duck-billed platypus to a dinosaur,\" Parn fumed. \"And the cities might be insect hives.\" With an exclamation of disgust, Wolek Parn snapped a switch, flooding the compartment with light. He turned off the scope and paced to his desk where he dropped wearily into his seat and faced them, arms draped across his legs, his shoulders slumped dejectedly. \"We can send a launch down, of course,\" hb said gloomily. \"But it\\'ll be a one-way trip because of fuel considerations. If it goes down, it stays. And so it has to take a load of colonists with it, or somebody gets left behind in the long run. How can I send twenty-four guinea pigs down into the hands of -- of what?\" Sahl shrugged. \"You can ask for volunteers.\" Parn leaned forward, clasped his head in his hands, and shook it slowly. \"Eventually, I guess I\\'ll have to. Right now, I\\'m faced with telling them. About the cities. They\\'ve been impatient as hell to know what\\'s going on. Why we landed here. A few more hours and they\\'ll start getting mad.\" first time. \"Why don\\'t you put it to them as a vote, Skipper? Make them responsible for deciding.\" \"Suppose they decide to load everybody in the launches and go down right now?\" \"Well -- suppose they do? Can you say definitely that it\\'s the wrong decision?\" \"No, I guess not.\" \"I can,\" Sahl growled. \"But you needn\\'t give them that choice. Ask for volunteers for a first launch, then let the volunteers decide whether they want to jump right in, or wait and see if there\\'s any reaction to our presence here on the planet\\'s moon.\" Parn nodded thoughtfully and sighed. \"I guess it\\'s the only thing to do.\" There was a brief silence, suddenly interrupted by a knock at the entrance. \"Colonists,\" Parn mut-. tered, \"wanting to know what\\'s up.\" He raised his voice. \"Okay! Come in!\" The hatch opened, and a young officer leaned inside without entering. \"It\\'s Rulian, Sir. He wants to see you.\" \"Ru -- I thought I sent him out to scout the surface.\" \"He\\'s back, Sir.\" \"All right, send him in.\" , The officer nodded and vanished. A pudgy, florid man stepped hurriedly inside. He was panting slightly, appeared to . be nervous. He still wore a pressure suit, but the helmet had been removed. He brushed at his disheveled hair and gazed at Parn. \"Well, what is it? Surely you didn\\'t have time to finish -- \" Rulian shook his head quickly. \"No, Sir. We got halfway to the hills. And then we came back. We thought you ought to know right away.\" \"Know what?\" The scout held something out on the palm of his hand -- a torn bit of metal. Parn frowned questioningly. \"Looks like -- maybe a shearedoff rivet. So?\" \"Just brought it back so you wouldn\\'t think I was off my rocker, Skipper.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Out there -- on \\' the surface. There\\'s the entrance to a tunnel, with an air-lock. A meteorite clobbered it -- long time ago, maybe.\" He tossed the bit of metal on Parn\\'s desk. \"That\\'s from the wreckage of the lock.\" A hush fell over them. Parn reached for the bit of metal, rolled it around in his palm with a blunt finger. Morgun Sahl was the first to break the silence. \"Well, Skipper -- I guess that determines what we do next.\" \"Eh? Oh, yes. Sahl, I guess the job is yours, since we don\\'t have an archeologist aboard. Pick whoever you need.\" Sahl glanced at Faron Qun and Alaia. \"You two want to go?\" The girl glanced at Qun. The chemist paused, then nodded. \"We\\'ll get suits and meet you outside.\" Chapter II and sunswept under a lurid sky. The moon possessed a thin atmosphere of xenon and other heavy gasses that tempered the harshness of the sun-glare and painted the blackness of space with a translucent film of sky. Morgun Sahl glanced at the wrist-indicators of his suit. The pressure was around two pounds, and temperature a modest # Fahrenheit. He stood outside the lock with Rulian, waiting for Qun and Alaia, The scout was pointing to a low outcropping of rock perhaps four hundred yards from the ship. \"The tunnel is just beyond that,\" came the scout\\'s voice in his headsets. \"Believe me, Sahl, I about dropped over when I saw it. Who do you suppose dug it?\" \\' The biologist shrugged, and gazed moodily at the huge but faintly visible crescent that hung in the western sky. What manner of beings were watching them and waiting for a move? Man had never before touched a planet where flourishing life was possible. There was Mars, of course, with its stunted flora and primitive fauna. And the single planet of Alpha Centauri, with its steaming oceans full of marine life, but with a climate too hot for land-life except in fertile patches in the polar regions. Here, however, under the orange glare of an Eridanian sun, lay a world nearly Earthlike. So Earthlike that the eventual development of an intelligent species was almost inevitable, according to Sahl\\'s way of thinking. Merrigull had thought so, too, but he had allowed for a probable deviation from Earthlike conditions, and had guessed that the peculiarly human survival response called \"intelligence\" would not happen here. Obviously, Merrigull had guessed wrong. And one hundred and twenty colonists were left holding the bag, visitors without reservations, discovering too late that the inn was already full. Certainly the visitors would not be welcome. The only question in Sahl\\'s mind pertained to the amount of resistance the Eridanian life-forms would offer to their coming. It might be anything from grudging tolerance to fanatical opposition. In case of the latter, there was nothing to do but retreat, go back to Earth, if they could escape -- and try to laugh off the twenty-six lost years of life. Certainly there could be no forcing an entry into the Eridanian world against the will of the Eridanian civilization. The colony was equipped with no spectacular weapons, nor any way to maintain a technological culture for more than a generation. They had come hoping to begin with a society of small farms in some area where metals were plentiful, and to let their descendants gradually assemble the tools of a better civilization. him, and he turned to watch Alaia and Faron Qun climb down to join them. Across the cracked dry ground they strode, puffs of dust rising about their boots and drifting away on the thin breeze. The scout led them to the outcropping of rock, and they climbed it to stare at the plain beyond. The tunnel\\'s mouth, was only a small pock-mark of blackness on the ground, but there was a glitter of metal at its rim. Sahl stared at the terrain around it, then pointed to dark splotches on the ground a hundred yards beyond the tunnel. \"You examine those?\" he asked. \"Yeah, we looked at them. Ground looks fused. I\\'d guess it was used as a landing site.\" \"Probably. How about the lock? Think we can get through it?\" \"Have to hoist that wrecked hatch out of the way. I think four of us can manage it. If we can\\'t, I brought a torch.\" Sahl leaped from the outcrop and and drifted down the six-foot drop to level ground. The others followed. Moments later they stood at the mouth of the lock. Alaia kicked at a layer of dust with her boot, uncovered a smooth stone ramp in which the lock was set. Sahl knelt beside the torn hatchway to tug at the sheared metal door, wedged diagonally in the entranceway. \"It\\'s still fastened in one spot,\" he called. \"Let\\'s have that torch, Rulie.\" The scout fumbled at the valves of the two cylinders strapped to his back, then struck a blinding dart of blue-white flame from the handtorch. Sahl flipped a dark filter down over his visor, then played the torch slowly over the jagged metal. Minutes later, the fastening pulled loose. The hatch slipped deeper and wedged. \"All right, let\\'s heave. Don\\'t grab the hot spot.\" After a concerted effort, the hatch came free with a suddenness that sent Alaia sprawling. Faron Qun quickly helped her to her feet, leaving the others to struggle with the hatch. Sahl gave him a black look, but said nothing. Beneath the lock appeared a corridor heaped with cave-in rubble, but apparently passable. Sahl stared down for a moment, then eyed the scout. \"Notice anything,\" he grunted. \"Yeah,\" the other muttered. \"We\\'re not going to be able to stand up down there. Looks\\' like a crawlway.\" Sahl shook his head. \"It was probably designed to walk in all right -- but the designers evidently aren\\'t very tall. Four feet high at the most.\" He stepped into the wrecked lock and let himself down gingerly to the top of the rubble heap. He crouched to shine a light down along the corridor, then glanced up at the others. \"Can\\'t see much. Let\\'s go down. We\\'ll stick close together. And don\\'t touch anything that you don\\'t understand.\" He slid feet-first down the heap of rubble and crouched in the gloom below. The others followed. \"Last man ought to blaze a trail somehow, as we move along,\" he called. \"So we won\\'t get lost down here.\" of rock from the heap and scratched it experimentally on the wall. It left a discernible mark. Sahl nodded and turned to move along the narrow corridor. After a few paces, he went to his hands and knees and crawled. The ceiling was too low to permit walking without crouching uncomfortably. Blackness engulfed them, except for the light thrown by Sahl\\'s handlamp. They passed a turn and came to a second hatch. Sahl ran his flash around the edge. \"Tight seal,\" he grunted. \"Another lock.\" \"They\\'ve probably got the place split into compartments in case of a leak,\" Faron offered. Sahl heaved at the door with his shoulder, but it failed to budge. \"Try that button,\" Alaia suggested. The biologist snorted, but pressed the stud beside the hatch and held it down. With his helmet pressed against the metal, he thought he heard the feeble click of a relay, but the hatch remained closed. \"That disk,\" she called, reaching over his shoulder. \"Might be an emergency hand-control.\" \"All right, turn it,\" he growled. She twisted it hard. After two turns, Sahl glanced down to see a tiny spurt of dust licking up from a valve an inch above floor level. It startled him. He had expected no pressure to remain in the lock. When the jet of dust subsided, he heaved against the door again. It swung slowly open, revealing the inside of the lock. \"We\\'ll have to go through it two at a time,\" he said, then paused. \"Anybody think to bring a weapon?\" No one answered for a moment. Then Faron snapped irritably, \"Why should we, Sahl? Don\\'t be silly!\" \"Yeah. I\\'m being silly. Come on, Rulie, let\\'s go through.\" They crawled into the lock and closed the hatch. Sahl closed the valve from the inside, and found a similar control for the inner door. Then he watched the fabric of his suit go slowly slack as the \\'pressure built up in the lock. \"Open it.\" Rulie grunted. A slight tug brought the thick hatch swinging inward. They stared beyond the door into a long domed A Beaten by despair, she stoically awaited her fate. TSr, room. The ceiling seemed to glow faintly, and Sahl extinguished his flashlight to check it. Bands of faint luminosity provided a dim glowlight to the room. The last feeble flicker, he guessed, of a lighting system abandoned long ago. layer of dust lay thick over the., ledges and across the floor. The dust was marked in places, but the marks were not fresh, and dust had partially covered them again. They closed the hatch behind them so that the others could come through. Sahl glanced at his pressure gauge. \"Twelve pounds,\\' he muttered. \"I\\'m going to try a sniffer.\" Rulie protested. \"Might get a lungful of chlorine! I can test for oxygen .with the torch.\"  Sahl yelped and snatched it away from him before he struck a spark. \"Might get worse than a lungful of chlorine if you strike that thing in here!\" Rulie muttered apologetically. Sahl touched the sniffer valve at the side of his helmet and opened it a tenth of a turn, then cut off his oxygen supply and waited until the pressure in his suit fell to twelve pounds. Then he inhaled deeply several times. \"Don\\'t smell anything,\" he called, \"rtn going to open it all the way. If I keel over, catch me.\" The air in the room smelled musty, but after a minute\\'s experimental breathing he removed his helmet. Rulie loosened his own helmet, but the biologist tightened it for him again. \"If I\\'m all right after half an hour,\" he shouted against Rulie\\'s visor, \"you can take it off.\" The others followed them through the lock and looked around quickly. Without his helmet, Sahl could not hear their conversation except as a muffled murmur from behind their visors. He motioned for them to follow, then crossed the room to enter another corridor beyond. Somewhere in the station, nuclear reactors were still seeping a trickle of energy that kept a faint glow of light from the ceiling, and he hoped that Faron would be able to estimate the age of the place from radioactive decay. He sent Rulie back to call the Ark. As they progressed through a series of corridors, rooms and other locks, Sahl grew deeply puzzled. This was no observatory, nor was it an experimental station. It had apparently beep used as a transfer point to space, a way-station where landing launches from the planet shifted cargo or passengers with larger ships too bulky to land on the mother-world. Why had it been abandoned? Oxygen was still being released from the rocks. The place was still in fair condition. Had the builders abandoned space entirely? The station was not large, and an \\'hour\\'s exploration brought them to its limits. Faron had discovered the reactors in a vault beneath the main level, where they supplied heat to an extensive bank of thermopiles which still delivered a trickle of power to \\'the equipment. Faron let himself down into the vault to examine the equipment, while the others continued to explore the main level, having removed their helmets to breathe the still air of the station. zling over a four-foot cube of transparent plastic that rested on a low pedestal in the center of the floor. \"Know what it\\'s for?\" he asked. She shook her head and took a last swipe at the dust that covered it. \"It\\'s clear except for a few specks of something. Air bubbles maybe.\" Sahl extinguished his light and noticed that she stepped away from him quickly in the darkness. He grinned sourly to himself, and waited until his eyes adjusted to the lack of light. \"What\\'s the idea?\" she muttered suspiciously. \"Look at the specks in the plastic.\" \"Why -- they shine faintly ! Why?\" \"Probably bits of radioactive material covered with a phosphor.\" He studied it in silence for a moment. One group of dots appeared to be joined by a web of fine lines. Their colors ranged from dull red to blue-white, and they varied in he said suddenly. \"That small orange one near the center of the web. Epsilon Eridani, their sun.\" \"Why the web?\" . \"Probably indicates the places their ships have -- \" He stopped suddenly and sucked in his breath. The web included Sol. Alaia interpreted his silence. \"I wonder how long ago,\" she murmured. Sahl turned as footsteps approached from behind. It was Rulie, and he seemed puzzled by an object in his hand. He held it out and stared at Morgun Sahl. \"Bone, Sahl?\" The biologist took the six-inch fragment and turned it over once. His hands seemed to freeze as they held it, and he was silent for several seconds. \"Where did you find this, Rulie?\" \"Back by the rubble heap, when I went back out to check with the Ark. Why? What is it?\" The biologist looked up slowly. \"Piece of a human tibia,\" he said, and his voice was somehow flat. tion!\" Parn was saying as he paced the floor of his cabin, occasionally glancing at Sahl. \"What\\'s that, Skipper?\" \"An Earth civilization that archeologists don\\'t know anything about. A civilization that got to space before it died out and disappeared.\" \"I don\\'t think so,\" Sahl disagreed quickly. \"A civilization like that would leave too many traces. If primitive architectural ruins stand for thousands of years, as in Egypt -- think how long the remains of a technological culture would endure. No, Skipper, I don\\'t agree at all.\" \"All right, damn it! How do you explain that piece of bone.\" \"I don\\'t.\" Pam snorted irritably. \"Do you even know it\\'s human?\" The biologist shrugged. \"You got the surgeon\\'s opinion to confirm my own.\" \"Isn\\'t there any way to tell how old it is?\" \"The lab\\'s working on it, but they aren\\'t very experienced at that sort of thing.\" \"What about this carbon# method?\" Sahl nodded indifferently. \"They\\'ll try it, but we can\\'t trust results.\" \"Why not? I thought it was very accurate?\" \"It is -- on Earth, where we know the percentage of radioactive carbon ingested during life. But how long had the fellow been away from Earth? And what percentage did he get while he was away? Was he even bom on Earth?\" Pam clenched his fists and began beating his knuckles together with thoughtful regularity while he paced the floor. \"Maybe humanoid creatures evolve wherever it\\'s possible,\" he ventured. \"Maybe the cities down there are -- \" \"What about those four-foot ceilings in the station?\" Sahl interrupted. \"That tibia came from a man about our height.\" Parn clucked irritably. \"Well, you said some of the ceilings were ten feet and over. \"Why don\\'t you judge from that?\\' Sahl smiled wryly. \"How about -- say -- the Cathedral of Notre Dame. Would you judge the stature of the builders by the height of the nave, or by the size of the smallest door?\" Parn grunted defeat. \"All right, why don\\'t you venture an opinion.\" \"It\\'d be more in the nature of a wild guess, I think.\" \"Make it, then.\" \"Well -- let\\'s turn the situation around. Suppose we had come here as explorers rather than as colonists. Suppose we landed on the planet and found a semi-intelligent species, and we were interested in studying it further. Suppose we captured a few, and carried them back home for breeding purposes.\" as if to interrupt, but Sahl continued : \"That three-dimensional star-map we found makes me think the builders have visited Sol. If they visited it before Man began civilizing himself, we\\'d have no legends, nor any trace of the visit. They could have made off with a few humans and we\\'d never know it had happened.\" \"Why would they want humans?\" Sahl shrugged. \"Why do we catch wild animals and put them in cages? Why did we domesticate dogs? Curiosity, maybe some usefulness. Man has brought back specimens from every planet he\\'s ever visited. Maybe he\\'s been a specimen himself. It\\'s just a guess.\" \"Pretty wild guess, if you ask me,\" Pam snorted. \"Human beings would be rather dangerous pets to have around.\" \"Would they? Humans have made pets -- or slaves -- of humans.\" Parn slumped into a chair, shaking his head slowly. \"None of which answers the question: \\'What are we going to do?\\' \" \"How are the colonists taking it?\" \\' \"Better than I expected. They\\'re restless, but quiet. Maybe too quiet. I don\\'t know. I let them out of the ship to roam around. They work off steam that way.\" \"If they\\'re not getting disturbed,\" Sahl offered, \"I suggest we wait until we\\'ve gone over that station with a fine-tooth comb. Faron is still puzzling over the reactors. And we might learn more about the builders by closer study of the interior structure.\" \"How?\" \"Well, by measuring dimensions, for one thing. The shape of the doorways suggest that they\\'re small bipeds -- or at least, their height is about three times their width. And Faron found something else down in the reactor vault that might be significant.\" \"What\\'s that?\" \"A pair of goggles, a circuit diagram, and a place to sit down. The goggles are too closely spaced for human eyes, and perfectly round, but the strap just about fits my head. The circuit diagram is hung on a wall, and we have to stoop to read it. And the\\' seat would be about the right height for a child with a foothigh knee.\" Pam threw up his hands. \"All right. Go ahead and study all you want to. Until they start shooting at us, anyway.\" Sahl glanced at the scope, noticed that it was on. He grinned. \"Been watching for them to start?\" \"I\\'ve been watching. Now get out, Sahl. I got some worrying to do. Go find Alaia.\" The biologist stiffened. \"What makes you say that?\" \"Eh? What makes -- ?\" The captain paused, smirked sadistically. \"Oh, sorry. I must have been thinking of Faron Qun, eh? Don\\'t slam the door.\" Sahl left it open instead, but he heard it slam when Parn got up to close it. He smiled irritably, and went down through the colonists\\' quarters to listen to the chatter. But the chatter was absent. Gloom pervaded the ship. He felt it hanging tensely, murderously, in the air, waiting to become rage or rebellion or sudden popular decision. These people were not going back to Earth. They had gambled thirteen years and they didn\\'t intend to quit as losers. He passed quietly through the passenger-areas of the ship, and stopped at his own quarters long enough to slip into a pressure suit. He stopped again at Alaia\\'s cabin, hesitating before the door. But he moved on without knocking. It might embarrass someone if Faron Qun were with her. Sahl tried to grin his way around the twinge of anger that followed the thought, but he failed to rid himself of it. and stepped out through the lock. Lunar night, with the planet\\'s The colonists had tagged the planet \"Merrigull\\'s Guesswork\", had later shortened it to \"Guesswork\", Sahl had idly speculated that after a dozen, or ten dozen generations, appearance. Their number-system was octal, suggesting perhaps fourfingered hands. Their written language was not phonetic, but seemed to be based on a system of ideographs, and a rather complicated system at that. It occurred to Sahl that they might not communicate by sound-waves, but he dismissed the notion as growing out of fragmentary evidence. A telephone circuit had been run from the Ark to the underground station. It began jangling frantically\"Sahl!\" Pam bellowed when he picked it up. \"A spacecraft has been sighted about five miles away, over the hills! It\\'s just hanging there on its jets, watching us. Get. back to the Ark. Everybody.\" The biologist gathered an incredulous frown. \"What kind of a ship?\" he gasped. \"Sleek little rocket. About half the size of a launch. Hurry back. If it lands, I want you to size up the occupants.\" \"Okay, Skipper. But I doubt that there\\'re any of them in it. I\\'ll bet it\\'s a remote control ship, or a computer-piloted job.\" \"Why? What makes you say that?\" \"Simple. They don\\'t know anything about us. They\\'re probably holding up a hat on a stick to see if we\\'ll shoot at it, and maybe to see what kind of weapons we\\'ve got. I\\'ll be right out.\" He hung up and yelled at the others, then scrambled through the lock and out of the station. He paused to peer at the dark sky in search of the ship, then found it at about thirty degrees above the horizon in the west. A silvery sliver that glittered in the sun, nose pointed skyward as if landing. But the thrust of its jets just matched the tug of gravity, and it hung motionless in mid-air, breathing a fiery tail downward, Sahl sprinted toward the Ark. Faron and Alaia and several others of the staff were assembled in Parn\\'s cabin when he burst inside. The Captain waved him to a seat. Faron was speaking. \"It\\'s probably a television ship sent to scan us, Skipper. I think we ought to make some friendly gesture toward it, or at least not behave hostilely. We could probably bring it down with a few bursts, but it\\'d undoubtedly lead to trouble.\" \"No question about that,\" Parn muttered. \"Well, Said? You itching to say something?\" \"Yes. Give me a pilot and a launch and permission to blast off and approach the vessel cautiously.\" \"Wh -- why? Suppose it shot you down? We\\'d lose a launch, and twenty-four people will be stranded. No, I can\\'t do it.\" He shook his head quickly. \"Of course it\\'s a risk, but it might pay off. Suppose it is a robot ship? If I can board it and ride it back to the planet, we\\'ve gotten an emissary down there without wasting a launch.\" Parn sat with his mouth open for a moment, then shouted: \"And suppose it\\'s a one-way ship? Suppose it doesn\\'t go back -- but only sits there and -- \" \"Skipper!\" A low gasp from Alaia who had been watching die screen. They stared. The small rocket, motionless at first, had begun to move. Tilting its axis at a slight angle, it began whisking rapidly to ward them. Wolek Parn went white and began jabbing buttons. \"Man emergency stations, all hands!\" he bellowed into the intercom. \"All hands in pressure suits, man the launches! Prepare for blast-off!\" Alaia and the other launch pilots scrambled through the door. Faron raced for the reactor room. Sahl sat \\'quietly staring at the screen. \"Well, everybody got some exercise anyhow,\" he said as the rocket landed on the flats beyond the tunnel\\'s mouth, fanning up \\' great whirls of scorched dust. He climbed to his feet. \"Coming?\" he grunted over his shoulder. \"Don\\'t go out there!\" Pam barked. \"Let them make a first move.\" \"They\\'ve already made it,\" he called back through the hatch. \"If they wanted to mess us up, a few armor piercing shells are all they needed to do the job. Coming?\" Mumbling irritably, the Captain reached for his helmet. Chapter IV the rockef was a slender spire through the thin haze as they left the Ark\\'s lock and began walking slowly across the lunar plain. \"See that black hole in the hull?\" Pam snapped. \"They\\'re either watching us or aiming at us.\" \"I see it. Let\\'s keep walking.\" \"Probably a television camera, eh?\" \"If it makes you feel any better to think so.\" \"Sgerul ingbagge khannil du ?\" came a third voice on the interhelmet communicator frequency. The men glanced at each other nervously. Sahl shook his head. \"It wasn\\'t me, Skipper.\" Parn set his jaw and glared\\' fixedly at the rocket as they approached. A hatch slid open in its side, revealing an empty lock. Something began snaking down from the lock toward the ground. \"What the -- !\" \"A ladder!\" Sahl breathed. \"A flexible ladder. They want us to come up. What do you think?\" Pam paused. \"I -- I don\\'t like it. I wish they\\'d show themselves.\" He paused again. \"But we\\'ve got to face them sometime, I guess.\" \"Yeah.\" They stood at the foot of the ladder, looking up the wall of gleaming metal toward the lock. A lense, projecting from the side of the ship had turned downward to survey them with its mechanical gaze. Sahl grunted nervously and started climbing. Soon he felt Parn coming after him. What manner of creatures were they about to meet? Or was the ship remotely piloted? Once they were inside, would it blast off without warning -- a specimen bottle that had been filled? He scrambled up into the lock and stood gazing back toward the Ark as Parn climbed up after him. raent of you runs contrary to your ethical system. We did not realize it before the hypnotic interview. You are not prisoners. We wished only to establish contact, and to study you. We welcome your colony to our planet.\" the reclining figure beyond the glass partition. The puffy, Neanderthaloid features of the saffron man, and the small circular tattoo on his shoulder, and the simple white loincloth that he wore did not somehow jibe with the complex science suggested by the visible equipment. The man\\'s head was bald, with a heavy protruding brow and a small flat skull. His body was thick and heavy, with long arms and broad hands. Sahl imagined that he would stoop when standing, for his shoulders, though thick, seemed steeply sloping. \"May I ask some questions?\" he grunted. \"Certainly,\" purred the loudspeaker. \"Are you the dominant race on the planet?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are your ancestors locally evolved?\" \"Yes.\" Sahl hesitated, staring at the man. He shook his head slowly. Somehow he could not believe that the fellow was not originally descended of Earth stock. \"Apparently your race has explored extensively in space during its history. Why did you give it up?\" A brief pause, then: \"We found what we regard as a more mature goal than mere widespread expansion. For thousands of years our activities have been directed toward the biologic integration of all lifeforms on our planet.\" \"Into a world-organism, you mean?\" \"Ultimately perhaps. Interdependence and elimination of destructive parasitism are the immediate goals. Symbiosis rather than conflict. You might call it biologic socialism.\" \"With your race leading and integrating?\" \"Naturally.\" It sounded plausible, Sahl thought. Perhaps earthlings would someday become bored with the stars and turn back to their own planet to \"rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures\". For they had never really tried to do so, had never tried world-wide schemes of biologic control. \"But why,\" he said slowly, \"are you ready to invite outsiders? What makes you think we would cooperate?\" time, then: \"We have taken in other outsiders. The fauna and flora of our planet is no longer local, but a composite -- made up of selected species from forty star-systems. You will find it something like an artificial garden. It would be virtually impossible for you not to cooperate.\" Sahl wondered how much information had been gleaned from him along with his language. Quite a lot, he guessed, since the very structure of a language implied many things about the linguistic animal that spoke it. \"Maybe you understand,\" he said slowly, \"why we came here. We want to establish a colony and try to equip it with our own brand of culture. Our culture is expansive, exploitive. I fail to see how it could fit in without some strong shift in cultural goal.\" \"That would be expected.\" Sahl frowned. \"You don\\'t understand. Our cultural continuity is as important to us as \\'genetic continuity.\" \"Why?\" The biologist groped for an explanation. \"A leader of one of our primitive tribes once put it this way, when his own culture was dying. He said, \\'In the beginning, God gave to every people a cup of clay, from which it drank its life. Now our cup is broken.\\' \" The Eridanian was silent for a long time. When he spoke, his tone remained unchanged -- for the machine had but one tone, one rhythm of speech. But Sahl somehow felt an aura of menace associated with the words. \"If you wish to survive, you must come to our planet. If you come to our planet, you must conform to our patterns and our plans. You cannot come to expand and exploit.\" Sahl weighed it carefully for a moment. \"Before we decide, may we send a delegation down to look around?\" \"That was anticipated,\" came the quick reply. \"We will take your delegation down and bring it back.\" A pause, then: \"Wolek Parn has awakened. We will speak with him. Then you may return to your ship to discuss the matter among yourselves if you wish.\" There was a click, and the loudspeaker went dead. A sudden thought came to him. How did the fellow know Parn was awake? He had not moved nor opened his eyes. Sahl watched him carefully. His lips still moved, but no sound penetrated the glass wall. Evidently the translator\\'s output had been channelled to another compartment. Evidently the fellow was talking to Parn. Two hours of waiting and watching followed, two hours during which a suspicion flickered in his mind, and grew to proportions of near-certainty: the man who lay on the table and talked was a cat\\'s paw, a servant of something else. But who was using him? Observation failed to answer the question or even confirm the suspicion. A panel slid open behind him, revealing the door to the airlock. His helmet lay on the floor. He fastened it quickly in place, and the airlock opened. Simultaneously Parn entered it from a flanking hatch. They glanced at each other silently, grimly, but neither spoke. Before the hatch closed behind Parn, Sahl saw another glass cubicle beyond it. Another suspicion entered his mind: that this ship had been designed specifically for this one mission. Moments later, they were descending the ladder to the plain below, and the comforting beam of a searchlight picked them up from the Ark. It was night, and the warm tinted crescent of the planet shone overhead. Somehow it seemed gloomy and forbidding. Chapter V viewed all four of us separately,\" said Parn when they were back in the Ark again. \"Let\\'s compare notes. I\\'ll begin with what happened to me.\" The Skipper related his conversation with the Eridanian matterof-factly, and it differed only in detail from Sahl\\'s experience. The Skipper apparently had reacted more angrily, but the general line of discussion was the same. The same was true of the others, except for Faron Qun, who apparently had been more eager than the rest to take advantage of the Eridanian\\'s \"generous offer\", as he put it. \"Let\\'s get it straight,\" Pam grunted. \"I said flatly that we wouldn\\'t fit in like a cog in somebody else\\'s wheel. Sahl took a dim view of it. Alaia kept her mouth shut -- which was probably smart. And Faron, you thought their offer was a good idea.\" \"I still do.\" \"That remains to be seen. The point is, they probably realize now that there\\'s going to be a diversity of opinion among us. They might try to take advantage of it somehow. But the main question of course is: \\'What the devil do they have in mind for us?\\' \" \"They seem to want us, all right,\" muttered the girl. \"But why?\" \"Maybe the delegation can find out.\" \"That brings up the question of who\\'s going.\" Alaia glanced around quickly. \"How about us?\" Parn shook his head, grinning wryly. \"Not you, Ala. I\\'ll send Qun and Sahl.\" The girl reddened angrily, fell silent. Faron Qun touched her arm lightly. \"I\\'d rather you\\'d stay where it\\'s safer...\"  \"Excuse me. Skipper,\" Sahl interrupted sourly. \"But I think we\\'d better have a pilot along, just in case.\" Faron snorted contemptuously. \"In case of what?\" \"In case we have to seize the ship and come back on our own.\" \"Of all the silly -- \" \"Maybe it\\'s not so silly, Faron,\" Parn growled. \"I believe you\\'re right, Sahl.\" \"Not Alaia, of course, but -- \" She bounded to her feet angrily. \"Why not Alaia?\" she demanded. Parn sighed and shrugged. \"All three of you go, then. I\\'ll have to stay and watch over the brood, I guess. Try to get them to establish radio contact with us, so you can keep us informed.\" danian ship bearing the three Earthlings spaceward, climbed a column of flame. They sat locked in a small but comfortably furnished compartment until blast-off was accomplished and acceleration fell to something around a gravity. They waited. The compartment was locked. Sahl rapped sharply at the door, but there was no answer. \"No sightseeing, permitted,\" he grunted suspiciously. \"They probably just want to keep a balanced loading, so they don\\'t want us moving around.\" Sahl glanced at the pilot. \"Think so?\" he muttered. She frowned at him irritably, but shook her head. \"I doubt it. They must have automatic trimming mechanisms to correct for slight load unbalance.\" \"No sightseeing permitted, then,\" he reasserted. Faron sneered slightly. \"You\\'ve got a lousy attitude, Sahl. It makes me sick.\" \"That\\'s too bad,\" the biologist sympathized quietly. Alaia glanced from one to the other jf them. Then she twisted Faron\\'s ear with playful sternness. \"Sorry, darling, but you\\'re out of line this time.\" t He reddened, and fell silent. An hour passed. Alaia, normally calm, began to seem restless. She moved about the small compartment nervously, peering at each fixture and marking. \"This ship is new,\" she muttered. \"Brand new! I\\'ll bet it\\'s the first flight.\" Sahl watched her, but said nothing. She reached a grille-covered vent over the hatch and tried to pull herself up to peer through it. The grille came free and she fell clumsily. Faron helped her up, while the biologist stared up at the opening with interest. \"Only a ventilator duct,\" she said. \"Yeah, but -- \" Sahl stood up. \"Might be big enough to Crawl through.\" \"Not for you.\" Sahl glanced at her. She might be slender enough to wiggle into the duct, unless her hips... \"Get that notion out of your head, Sahl!\" Faron snapped. He picked up the grille and moved toward the opening to replace it. \"Put it down,\" Sahl said tonelessly. Something about his voice made Faron hesitate. Alaia said, \"Let me try it. I want a look at the control room.\" \"You\\'re not going to do it,\" Faron growled, blocking the duct opening. \"Move, Faron,\" murmured the biologist. \"Let\\'s not have a tussle.\" \"Let\\'s do.\" \"It would be rather one-sided, I\\'m afraid,\" Sahl grunted, producing an automatic. \"Ever get pistolwhipped, Qun?\" \"Wh -- where did you get that? What do you mean by bringing a weapon? This is supposed to be a peaceful -- \" \"Yeah. Now move. Help her up in the duct.\" Faron stepped reluctantly aside, his face bright with anger. Alaia gave him a peculiar glance, then scrambled up and into the opening without assistance. She glanced back at Sahl and beckoned him close. \"Three openings just up ahead. Watch down the duct in case I get caught.\" He handed her the gun and nodded. \"Don\\'t go too far. Return trip\\'ll be harder, backing up.\" She stuffed the gun in her belt and gave Faron a warning look. \"You better keep your temper, F.Q.\" She crawled slowly out of sight. Faron glared at the biologist; \"Fool! Don\\'t you imagine they\\'re watching us? Know exactly what\\'s going on?\" \"I doubt it. They\\'re probably too busy to bother.\" He climbed to the duct opening and glanced along it. Alaia\\'s body blocked the light from the other openings toward the front of the ship, but faintly he could hear her moving. \"Well?\" Faron growled. \"You watch if you want to.\" Sahl returned to a seat. Faron peered along the dark duct for several minutes. \"She\\'s reached another grille,\" he muttered suddenly. \"I can see the light -- and -- oh! no!\" \"What\\'s wrong?\" \"The grille came loose. She -- Alaia, no! No!\" then another. He scrambled for the opening, as Faronbegan beating frantically at the hatch. \"They saw her! They shot her!\" Sahl stared toward the faint light a dozen yards down the duct. He could see her faintly, her arm dangling from the \\'opening. She lay very still. Somewhere someone was screaming gibberish. \"Help me!\" Faron howled. \"Help me get it open!\" Together they battered the locked hatch. The light metal door seemed to give slightly with each crash. After four tries, the lock gave way, and they spilled out into the corridor. A few paces away, the saffronskinned man stood staring at them idiotically. Suddenly he opened his mouth and screamed. After a moment, he screamed again -- without moving. Scalp crawling, Sahl darted around him. He seemed not to see them, but continued screaming as they ran down the corridor. Faron kicked open a hatch, then froze. Sahl\\'s gun lay on the floor beyond it, and Alaia\\'s hand hung limply down from above. And there was something else. A small manlike creature with a huge head lay dead in a pool of red-brown blood near an instrument panel, his skull from the automatic. A fat handweapon with multiple barrels was still clutched in his small fist. \"See about Alaia,\" Sahl snapped, grabbing up the gun. \"I\\'ll watch the corridor.\" Faron stepped inside and felt her wrist. \"Thank God,\" he breathed, \"she\\'s alive. Unconscious.\" \"Wounded badly?\" \"I -- I can\\'t tell.\" He paused. \"There\\'s something stuck in her face. Help me get her down.\" Sahl paused. Another saffron crewman was coming along the corridor, feeling his way and stumbling, as if blinded. He kept pawing at his head. He moved past Sahl without glancing at him. The biologist watched him go, then stepped inside and helped Faron haul the limp girl down out of the duct. \"Damn you, Sahl! Now we\\'re in trouble, bad trouble!\" \"All right, save it till later, will you? There\\'s no time to fight about it now.\" They stretched her out on the floor and examined her for wounds. \"Nothing,\" Faron muttered. \"Except these little red marks on her face, and -- \" He bent over her and jerked three tiny splinters from her cheek and\\' laid them on his palm. \"Crystals. Sharp little crystals.\" and felt her pulse. \"I\\'d say she was drugged.\" He arose and crossed the cabin to bend over the dead creature. He disentangled the weapon from a slender four-digital hand and inspected it closely. He drew back what seemed to be a charging-plunger, then aimed at the dead thing and flicked a switch. It kicked in his hand and emitted a dull cough. Six crystals appeared, stuck in a patch of the creature\\'s hide. They began to volatilize at once. \"Anaesthetic crystals,\" he guessed. \"Must be quick acting, but not quick enough to keep Ala from shooting back when she got stung.\" \"This is terrible!\" Faron mourned. \"Now they\\'ll never let us colonize.\" \"Wake up, fellow,\" Sahl snapped, pointing at the dead creature. \"That\\'s one of our hosts, not the idiots with orange hides.\" He tossed Faron the Eridanian\\'s weapon and stepped through the hatch. \"I\\'m going to search the ship, see if he\\'s the only one.\" He moved warily along the corridors, peering cautiously into each compartment. He found one other saffron servant, curled up in the foetal position on the floor of a cabin. The man did not look up. There were no other creatures like the one Alaia had killed. And the three servants -- if such they were -- appeared to be completely demented. They seemed unaware of their surroundings, stared vacuous ly at nothing. The search convinced him that automatic devices were keeping the rocket on a constant heading with respect to the planet\\'s gravitic field -- which would make it a spiralling course with respect to a fixed framework. Unless the devices corrected when they reached the atmosphere, or unless they could get control of the ship, they would go in like a meteor and crash. He returned to the compartment where Alaia lay moaning but still unconscious. Faron was studying the instrument panels. He turned away white-faced to stare at the biologist. His voice was high and tense. \"Do you realize this is the control cabin? That thing was piloting the ship! Somebody\\'s got to take over!\" \"He\\'s the only one of his kind aboard. I guess it\\'ll have to be you. I\\'m a mechanical moron, Qun.\" Faron groaned. \"I can\\'t even pilot one of our own ships. And we\\'ll never be able to read the markings on these instruments, or know what they mean. The controls Zoo A: .fairly simplified, but -- \" He shook his head, pointed at the screen. The ship seemed to be plunging surfaceward at a shallow angle. \"We\\'ve got to get Alaia awake. Maybe she can analogize between those gadgets and familiar controls.\" Faron growled a low curse and went to the hatch. \"I\\'m going to see if I can\\'t shut off the jets somehow. We might still have enough of an orbital velocity-component to carry us around the planet, if we can stop the rockets from skidding us back any more.\" \"An orbit?\" \"Yeah. Probably with an underground perihelion. If we get out of this, Said, I\\'m going to kick your face in.\" \"I\\'ll be looking forward to it,\" the biologist murmured, as he knelt beside Alaia. instrument panel\\'s lights began flashing frantically, and relays clattered loudly. He straightened, sensing vaguely that they were falling. His weight was diminishing rapidly. Then he noticed that the thunder of the rockets was dying. It became a dull roar, then a purr. Faron came back, \"d got the reactors damped down,\" he said, \"but it may not matter. Look at the screen.\" Sahl turned. The scope revealed the curving horizon of the planet, but the cross-hairs rested only a fraction of a degree above the misty limb. \"Will we skim through that atmosphere?\" he asked. \"If we do, we\\'ll melt the hull off at this speed. We\\'ll just have to wait and see.\" He glanced down at the girl. \"How is she?\" \"Opened her eyes once. Drifted off again. Might bring her around if we had some sort of stimulant.\" Faron fumbled quickly through his suit, brought out a small vial. \"Neurodrine,\" he grunted. \"I brought it along to keep awake in case we were pretty busy.\" The biologist took it quickly and shook out two small capsules. \"You on the stuff?\" he asked. \"Of course not!\" The vehemence of the denial made Sahl guess that Faron was at least worried about the possibility of addiction. The drug did not set up a true craving, but habitual users became listless and apathetic when it was withdrawn, and they had to continue taking it in order to stay normally alert. He took the capsules apart and emptied the white powder in Alaia\\'s mouth. Her jaw worked spasmodically, and heTeld her mouth closed lest she reflexively spit out the bitter compound. Five minutes passed. Sahl became aware of a faint whine, high-pitched and all-per vading. He glanced at Faron who was staring at the instruments. \"Upper fringes of the atmosphere!\" the chemist groaned. \"That whistle?\" \"Yeah!\" He hurried out of the cabin and returned a moment later, his face taut with worry. \"What\\'s up?\" Sahl asked. \"The temperature. Leading edges of projections on the hull. Red spots here and there.\" He stared at the screen. The cross-hairs seemed a little higher above the horizon now, but the horizon\\'s curvature was less. \"We\\'re low, too low. Maybe sixty miles.\" \"Perihelion?\" \"Maybe we\\'re at it. But if that air slows us down enough, we\\'ll drop.\" She opened her eyes and pressed her hands to her temples. Her face went tense with fear. \"It shot... hurt -- my face. Where?\" \"No time now!\" Sahl grunted. \"Listen to .me. You\\'ve got to get control of the ship.\" \"The big head... the thing... is it -- ?\" \"Dead.\" She closed her eyes again and moaned. Sahl shook her hard. \"Alaia! Listen tome!\" \"Sick... Water...\" He shook her again, then pulled her up to a sitting position. She saw the dead creature, and her eyes widened. She gasped and seemed to recover a little. She stared at the control panel and shook her head. \"That whine!\" she gasped. \"Air!\" Sahl helped her to her feet. \"Faron got the jets idled,\" he told her quickly, \"but that\\'s all. You\\'ve got to figure out the controls.\" She staggered toward the instrument panel and stared. \"I\\'ll never be able to read those things. But...\" She looked down at the array of switches and studs. \"Only two variable controls,\" she muttered. \"The rest are on-off. I hope thisthing is -- \" She touched a lever  and bent close to inspect it. \"Ball and socket mounting. Can push it any direction. That means -- \" She pushed it forward slightly. \"No!\" Faron howled. \"Look at the screen!\" The cross-hairs had split into a pair, one set red, the other black. The black set rested now below the horizon. \"Don\\'t worry,\" she muttered. \"That must be just the aim of our nose. I didn\\'t feel a course-change.\" She tugged back slowly on the lever. A low drone came from the instrument panel. The black crosshairs drifted slowly upward, and the planet\\'s horizon swept completely off the screen. The scope revealed only a patch of space. \"Must be a stern pick-up somewhere.\" She touched one of the switches under the scope, then returned it to the original position. \"Magnification. And this one -- intensity. And this -- \" The scene on the scope changed abruptly and the planet\\'s surface appeared again. \"That\\'s it. Now we\\'re looking back toward the tail.\" She turned abruptly to look at Faron. \\'.\\'Howdid you get the reactors damped?\" \"Back in the power room. Slipped in a couple of rods.\" \"Better go slip them back like they were.\" lently. Minutes later, the rocket\\'s purr became a roar again. Alaia slowly moved the second control and the thunder waned, then grew again. The ship lurched clumsily as she fumbled with the headinglever, but gradually the planet\\'s surface lay directly tailward, and they were climbing slowly. The whine began to diminish. Faron returned from the power room to stare over her shoulder. \"Wonderful!\" he murmured. \"Not so wonderful, maybe,\" she said gloomily. \"We don\\'t know what the instruments are registering. One slip and we\\'re finished.\" \"Can we make it back?\" Sahl sskpd \"Back? To the moon? No!\" She shook her head emphatically. \"No way to navigate.\" \"What then?\" \"We\\'ll have to get in an orbit, let me practice on the controls. Then -- there\\'s nothing to do but try to land it somewhere down there. Unless you\\'d rather stay here as a permanent satellite.\" \"They\\'ll send other ships up after us,\" Faron said darkly. \"They\\'re probably watching us right now.\" Sahl stared at the surface revealed on the screen. \"I agree that they\\'re watching us. But I don\\'t think thev\\'ll send pursuit.\" \"Why not?\" \"It\\'s my guess that they don\\'t have anything to pursue us with. I believe this rocket was specially constructed for this one task.\" Faron snorted contemptuously. \"If they can build this one, they\\'ve certainly built others.\" \"Why?\" \"Well -- \" \"I\\'m certain they could build all the ships they wanted to,\" Sahl continued. \"And Earthlings could build humanoid robots if they wanted to. But who wants to? The Eridanians have deserted space. They don\\'t need to build ships, except for some special purpose, like this one.\" \"Maybe,\" Faron admitted. \"But if we stay here very long they\\'ll build one to come after us. If what you say is true, they certainly built this one in a hurry.\" The biologist nodded, glanced at Alaia. \"How long will it take?\" \"Somewhere between five minutes and forever,\" she answered curtly. \"Well, we land as soon as you think you can manage it. We\\'ll have to be careful about choosing a spot. Some place pretty far from a city. Let\\'s say -- high ground in the twilight zone.\" \"Why twilight?\" \"So that if we get down, we might try to get away in the dark.\" He paused. \"I\\'m going to look over the ship again and try to get something out of those crewmen. If that\\'s what they are.\" Chapter VI during which the ship lurched and rocked and spun as Alaia tested the controls. He came back looking grim, and went to bend over the dead Eridanian. He pried open its jaw and stared. \"Want it to say \\'ah\\'?\" Faron asked sourly. \"Look,\" Sahl grunted, pressing back the creature\\'s lips to expose the inside of his mouth. \"Toothless  # Faron observed, \"and no tongue. So?\" \"Look again.\" He inserted his finger and pressed something. A pair of gleaming white fangs slipped slowly into view. \"Hollow and retractile.\" Faron frowned. \"Poison sacs?\" \"No. Feeding mechanisms.\" \"A bloodfeeder!\" \"Not exactly. I found something growing on one of the crewmen\\'s backs. A parasite vegetable growth, I think. It\\'s taken root there -- deep roots. And there\\'s a pale green pulpy sphere on the outside. It had fang-marks on it. Seems to be full of a milky flind, but not blood. I\\'d say it\\'s the Truit of the parasite growth. And the fellow\\'s flesh is the ground it grows in.\" \"And he\\'s still alive?\" \"In a stupor. He\\'s the one curled up on the floor. Asleep, or unconscious.\" \"How about the others?\" \"They don\\'t have it. Apparently this thing -- \" He nudged the small body. -- just brought along one dinner pail.\" Faron shuddered. \"They\\'re slaves, then.\" \"Maybe. Better look the other way,\" he said, producing a pocketknife. He made a neat incision in the throat, and studied for a moment. \"Breathing tube, no real vocal cords. They can\\'t talk, nor even make much oral noise.\" \"Somebody was talking to us!\" the chemist protested.  \"Yeah, but I think this thing was using the saffron fellow as a mouthpiece; telepathic control. The human -- if he is a human -- spoke in his own language, and the machine translated. But the original thoughts must have come from this.\" Faron looked toward the door thoughtfully. \"I can\\'t even believe those people have a language. They act like complete idiots.\" Sahl looked up. \"I have an idea that\\'s withdrawal shock, rather than idiocy. If this little beastie was controlling them telepathically, they must have gotten some kind of jolt when Alaia shot it. And maybe they\\'ve been controlled so long that they\\'ve lost their own egos, lost their own personality.\" They looked up as the tug of acceleration decreased suddenly. \"Okay,\" Alaia called nervously, \"I guess it\\'s now or not at all. I\\'m going to start down.\" Sahl turned to watch the planet\\'s surface on the screen. It tilted again, revealed a horizon as she guided the ship so as to resume the process of cancelling out its orbital velocity component. \"I\\'ll have to do it fast,\" she called. \"We\\'re too close to the atmosphere. You\\'d better lie down -- or sit.\" to deafening proportions, and Sahl felt his weight tripling under the force of the thrust. He sat braced against the wall, watched Alaia\\'s face sag under the pressure. Soon the whine of atmospheric friction returned, and grew into a wild shriek. He inched away from the wall as it began to bum his back. Faron mopped his face with a heavy hand. \"Hot,\" he gasped. \"Lord, it\\'s getting hot!\" \"How\\'s it coming?\" Sahl shouted, but the girl was too tensely absorbed to answer. After a time the shriek seemed to diminish slightly, became a low howl, then a muffled drumming, scarcely audible above the roar of the rockets. The minutes crawled slowly past, and gradually the surface markings on the screen stopped their crawl. Their normal weight had returned, and the sound of the jets ceased to be deafening. \"How\\'s it coming?\" he called again. This time she answered. \"We\\'re just about stationary. Sitting on our thrust at -- oh, somewhere between twenty and thirty miles. I think I\\'ve located the radar-altimeter -- by watching it crawl back -- but I still can\\'t read it.\" \"Can you tell the zero-mark on it?\" the chemist called. \"Yes. But I\\'m afraid to trust it. There\\'s some kind of adjustment on the dial.\" \"There\\'s a small transparency port in the power room,\" Faron called. \"Want me to watch it?\" \"Yes. I\\'ll go down at about a mile a minute until vye\\'re a couple of miles up. Think you can yell when we\\'re at about ten-thousand feet?\" \"I\\'ll try,\" he muttered. \"How\\'ll you judge our rate of descent?\" She tapped an instrument dial. \"This thing seems to be an acceleration balance. It sits on this center mark when the thrust is just right to make me feel my normal weight. I\\'ve been comparing the reading with the feel of the thrust. We\\'ll start down slow, then keep it on the center mark. Warn me if we seem to be dropping too fast.\" Faron shook his head, muttered pessimistically, and left the cabin. The biologist sat watching the scope and feeling helpless. Slowly the surface markings spread, grew larger. The land was rising to meet them. Faron burst into the cabin again. \"Better slow it down,\" he called. \"We\\'re dropping pretty fast.\" The rockets droned louder for a \\' moment, and the screen markings ceased to spread. Alaia risked a quick glance at Faron\". \"What kind of country down there?\" \"Hilly,\" he said, then glanced at the scope and touched it. \"This place right here looks like a valley. Fairly flat.\" She nodded and touched the controls lightly. The marking crept slowly under the crosshairs, then stopped. The descent began again. Sahl saw that her only yardstick of velocity lay in the seeping spread of the markings on the scope. She occasionally glanced at the acceleration balance, but her eyes turned quickly back to the screen. Faron had returned to the power room. quickly about the controls as the spread became more rapid. She muttered through gritted teeth. Sahl braced himself and waited. Faron was shouting from the power room, but the roar made his voice unintelligible. \"See what\\'s the matter with him!\" she snapped suddenly. \"I\\'ll hold us right here.\" The roar increased slightly as she nudged the thrust control, and the spread ofthe marking slowed to a halt. Faron was mopping his face on his sleeve as Sahl entered the power room. \"About to go down in a gorge!\" he shouted. \"She\\'s got to move it over some.\" Sahl glanced at the transparent port, saw nothing but grayness beyond it. \"What\\'s that?\" \"Smoke. Our jets touched off the vegetation. We\\'re about a hundred yards up. No use watching any more. I\\'ll try to guide her in.\" They hurried back to the control cabin. Faron traced a finger lightly along a dark marking on the scope. \"Deep cut,\" he told her. \"Move it over here.\" The scenery began to crawl. \"Say when!\" she called. \"Take it slow -- all right, now!\" \"Check. Brace yourselves. We\\'re going in.\"  Seconds later, a series of muffled tearing sounds echoed through the ship. Then a settling jar. She killed the jets. \"Down!\" gasped Faron, sitting up. \"Watch out!\" Alaia screamed Suddenly. \"We\\'re going over!\" The room began to tilt, first slowly, then gathering impetus. Sahl scrambled toward the down-going wall. A thunderous roar. A bonecrushing jolt. A body slammed against him hard, and the wind #l went out of him. The room spun crazily, and the jolts continued, as if they were rolling down a hill. His head slapped hard against the wall. Awareness faded. The jolting had stopped. Apparently he had blacked out for only a few seconds, for Alaia was still untangling herself from him when he shook the fog away. \"Sorry, Sahl,\" she muttered. \"I didn\\'t mean to use you for a crash pad. You just got in the way.\" self sitting on the dead Eridan ian, and arose to stand on the slightly inclined wall. Faron lay groaning in the corner. \"Nice landing,\" Sahl breathed, and meant it. \"Faron\\'s hurt!\" she gasped, bending over him. \"His leg! It\\'s all -- \" Sahl knelt to take a look. \"Broken,\" he muttered, then began splitting the fabric of his suit. \"Broken femur.\" He shook his head and reached for the Eridanian\\'s crystal gun. \"No!\" the girl protested, knocking his hand away. He glowered at her. \"Rather listen to him scream while I splint it?\" \"But -- \" \"It didn\\'t kill you, did it?\"  \"All right, but -- if he\\'s unconscious -- he can\\'t -- \" He looked at her sourly. \"Can\\'t come trotting along with us?\" He held the gun close to Faron\\'s shoulder, pressed the firing switch, and waited for the groans to stop. Then he brushed away the crystals that remained halfimbedded in his skin. \"Go find me something long and straight for a splint,\" he grunted, and began ripping Faron\\'s suit into strips. She came back after a few minutes, empty-handed. \"All I found was a long metal rod, but it must weigh thirty pounds. He\\'s heavy enough as it is.\" He gazed at her quietly. \"You planning to carry him, Ala?\" She sucked in a short breath. \"Why, I -- \" \"Get the rod, if you want it splinted.\" She hesitated, then went back to get it. \"We\\'re hanging over the edge of a bluff. It\\'s a wonder we didn\\'t roll into it,\" she called. \"Let\\'s have the rod.\" She gave it to him, then watched as he packed one end of it under Faron\\'s arm, then bound it to his body from the chest down. Gradually it seemed to dawn on her that Faron wasn\\'t going any place. \"Pull this tight and tie it when the fracture pops in place,\" he muttered, then sat down to stretch the limb against the writhing knot of muscles. There was a dull snapping sound, \"Tie it!\" he grunted. Minutes later, Sahl arose panting. \"It may not be properly set, but that\\'ll keep it from compounding, anyhow. Let\\'s go.\" She shook her head slowly. \"I\\'m not going anywhere.\" He frowned sharply. \"Listen! It\\'s certain that someone spotted our landing. It\\'s equally certain that we can\\'t move Faron, and that they\\'ll get him anyway. Your presence w\\'on\\'t help him a damn bit.\" \"I can\\'t just desert him!\" \"If you don\\'t, you\\'ll be deserting a hundred and twenty others.\" \"I don\\'t see how -- \" \"We came down here to look around, get information, and get it back to the Ark. I don\\'t know how we can accomplish it now, but I know we can\\'t do it just sitting here waiting to be captured. They\\'re probably on their way here now. Come on, let\\'s get moving.\" She looked down at Faron and bit her lip. \"All right. I\\'ll come,\" she said hoarsely. \"But Sahl, I hate your guts.\" the low hillside about the ship. By their light, he could see that they had landed in what appeared to be a garden, or an orchard. The sun had set, and only a trace of twilight lingered in the west. A faint breeze washed the hillside and whispered in the foliage of the shrub-like trees. The breeze brought pleasant odors: a wisp of smoke, the smell of moldering leaves, a faint perfume from the trees. Despite the danger, they paused a moment savoring the feel of mossy earth under their feet. \"Thirteen years,\" Alaia kept murmuring, \"thirteen long years.\" The \"orchard\" was cool and pleasant, the trees shaped like inverted hearts, with the foliage draped from the branches like tassels. They reminded Sahl of weeping willows, except for their nearperfect symmetry. It was indeed a garden world -- and old, old and carefully tended. She caught his arm suddenly. \"Sahl! Lights moving in the sky! Up there!\" He gazed in the direction she pointed and saw them. The breeze brought the faint drone of engines. Circling aircraft. He moistened his lips nervously and hesitated. \"Probably sent to spot the rocket. But they can\\'t land here, not unless they do it the same way you did.\" \"Yes, but they\\'ll guide a ground party to us.\" He nodded and walked to the rim of the gorge. A hundred feet down to the rush of water over rocks. The moon was rising, and by its faint light he saw the dim whiteness of a small waterfall. \"Let\\'s go,\" he grunted, and began trotting toward higher ground, following the lip of the cliff a dozen yards on their right. \"Where to?\" she called from behind. \"How should I know? Anywhere, away from that rocket. We\\'ll stay on the crest of the ridge. It seems to follow the gorge. Down there might be a good place to hide, if we have to.\" \"This moss is too soft. Sahl, we\\'re leaving a clear trail.\" \"I know it, but I hope they won\\'t find it before morning.\" \"Those lights. They\\'re circling lower. They\\'ve seen the fires.\" a \"Yeah. Save your breath for running.\" The crest of the ridge steepened and angled away from the gorge and led them tt a steep hill that arose on their left. They scrambled up a series of rocky ledges to a rain-guttered slope that was free of the moss. Regular patches of brush lay ahead. Alaia pleaded exhaustion and they paused to rest.  \"We must have run ten miles,\" she panted. \"Closer to four, maybe,\" he muttered, staring back at the orange etching of glowing embers on the hillside where they had landed. \"Sahl, look! Down the gorge toward the valley!\" \"Uh -- yes, lights. A whole swarm of them. And they\\'re moving.\"  \"Torches?\" \"I don\\'t think so. They -- they move too fast. And they\\'re too white for flame.\" They fell silent for a moment. \"I don\\'t hear anything. No engines.\" \"Too far away, maybe.\" \"The wind\\'s right. But -- look! They\\'re flying. Close to the ground, but they\\'re flying.\" \"Come on,\" he muttered, \"we\\'d better be moving.\" They climbed again, and as the brush thickened a moon-splashed cliff loomed ahead. They made for it, tearing through the brush and stumbling over the rocky ground. \"That cliff,\" Sahl muttered\"Looks like a mesa up there, or a high plateau.\" \"What good is it? Why do we keep climbing?\" \"To get a view of the land. So that if we last through tomorrow, we\\'ll see where to go.\" \"Sahl! Those lights. They\\'ve split up back by the rocket.\" He paused to follow her gaze, then tugged her on. \"Part of them coming this way. Hurry!\" \"But where?\" she gasped as she ran. \"The cliff\\'s got an overhang. We\\'ll get under it.\" \"The lights -- they wink on and off -- like signals. And they swarm around like wasps.\" \"Gome on!\" he snapped. \"You can watch them from under the overhang.\" Theysprinted across a clearing, then ran along the foot of the cliff until they reached a gulley where the rock hung like a jaw over thy ground. They crawled quickly back into the blackest shadows of the recess and sat panting on the moist rocks. \"Nice place for something big and stealthy and hungry to hang\\' out,\" she said with a shiver in her voice. \"Maybe. But I doubt if there\\'s anything like that left on this planet.\" He paused, and his voice changed slightly. \"Nothing, that is, except us.\" He heard her moisten her lips in the darkness, as if to speak, but she said nothing. Peering out at the night he caught a glimpse of the winking lights, momentarily visible beyond a dip in the ridge. \"They must have picked up our trail all right,\" he muttered. \"Let\\'s hope they lose it where the mossy ground ends.\" \"What are they?\" \"I don\\'t know but -- they\\'re getting closer. Listen!\" \"I don\\'t hear... She paused, then: \"Yes, I do -- faintly. It\\'s a whirring sound, like wings, like quail flying. A whole big covey of quail.\" \"That\\'s what it is,\" he whispered. \"Wings.\" He crawled closer toward the opening and stared. \"Fireflies. Giant fireflies, Ala -- only they\\'re probably nothing like fireflies except that they glow. Listen to those wings! And they light up a whole patch of hillside.\" \"Coming this way?\" \"They\\'re circling. Must have lost us.\" She laughed suddenly. \"Fireflies, chasing humans. It\\'s funny -- \" \"Don\\'t get hysterical, Ala!\" \"It\\'s really funny,\" she went on. \"All the quaint little life-forms, out to hunt us down. Watch out for the rabbits, Sahl! Beware of the sparrow patrol! They work in packs. I wonder what the fireflies are leading. A band of gophers? A flock of snakes?\" She laughed again, but choked it off in a hiss and a shiver. \"You\\'re not far from wrong,\" he muttered. \"They are leading something. There\\'s lots of rustling in the brush. But -- I think they\\'re heading the wrong way.\" \"Intelligent fireflies -- what next?\" \"Not intelligent, I\\'d guess. Just under control. Like a dog-pack.\" \"Under whose control? The little fat-heads?\" \"Remotely, I imagine. I wouldn\\'t be surprised but what every lifeform on the planet is controlled. The fellow we communicated with on the ship said as much. Or hinted at it.\" She was silent for a moment. \"Have the lights gone away?\" to the open and stared. \"They\\'re swarming up the cliff, about half-a-mile away -- up to the top of the mesa. I guess they think we went...\" \"What\\'s wrong?\" \"Nothing. I just happened to think: if they suspect we took that way, then there must be a path up the cliff down there -- or some reason why they think we\\'d want to climb it. Both, maybe.\" \"So?\" \"So maybe we should, if we get a chance.\" \"Sahl -- I\\'m too tired to move.\" \"Sleep awhile, if you can. I\\'ll watch.\" She murmured gratefully, and he heard her shifting around on the loose rock, seeking a place to stretch out. Suddenly she giggled. \"Something crawled down my back. I -- \" Then she choked out a yelp. \"Sahl, help me! It stings, and I can\\'t reach it.\" With a worried grunt he crawled back to where she lay, trying to claw at something between her shoulder-blades. He slipped his hand down the neck of her suit and felt along the smooth skin until he found it -- a rough scaly little disk that clung tight to her back. He pinched it hard and jerked. She whimpered as the thing came free. Sahl struck a light and studied it briefly -- a leathery creature with wiry tendrils that moved very slowly, as if groping for the hold they had lost. His face remained expressionless. \"What is it?\" she asked. \"Nothing much,\" he grunted. He laid it on a rock and burned it. It wasn\\'t much, as it stood -- but he had seen the mature one with the pale green fruit, growing with its roots buried deep in the flesh of a man. \"Better sleep up closer to the front,\" he advised. The moon rose higher in the starflecked sky, and hff watched the quiet land with its orderly patterns of vegetation, and the winking lights that circled slowly over it. The orderliness implied ownership. Here was no primitive forest waiting for the axe and the plough. Here was no place for a colony. He glanced at the lurid disk of the moon and tried to pick out the landing site where over a hundred humans waited and watched. In vain. No, they would not turn back, would not spend the long years required for the journey home. They would come down here eventually. And when they came, what would be their role in the scheme of the world? Servants? Or merely an organ in the biologic corporation the native Eridanians were building? the breeze, voices and the rustle of brush. He frowned, brought out his gun, and stretched out on his stomach to wait. The search was continuing. Peering carefully, he finally spotted them a hundred yards away. A dozen of the saffronskinned manlike creatures were beating about in the brush and talking among themselves. The language seemed monosyllabic and primitive, but somehow human, designed for the acoustics of the human throat. Sahl felt certain that they were not locally evolved, but rather had descended from primitive Earthlings, captured by the Eridanian space-wanderers during their day of expansion. How long ago? Judging by their bone structure, he guessed it to be\\' at least fifty thousand years. Mutations had occurred, of course ; their coloring and their loss of hair had undoubtedly come about since their departure from Earth. Also their ability to commune telepathically with the Eridanian species. The latter specialization seemed to suggest forced breeding. The searchers were wandering closer. They seemed to carry no weapons except staves, and their only source of light was the moon. Since they spoke among themselves, he guessed that they were free agents rather than telepathicallycontrolled creatures such as the ones they had encountered on the ship. Sahl retreated deeper into the recess. The party reached clear ground fifty yards down the cliff, then turned and wandered toward the place where the\\' fugitives lay hidden. He quickly searched through the pockets of Alaia\\'s suit and found the crystal gun, which seemed preferable to the more lethal automatic, in case they were ch \\'covered. The party paused occasionally to prod under the edge of the cliff with their staves. Didn\\'t they realize that the Earthlings were armed? That numbers were no match for guns? of laughter from the group, then a sudden shriek -- a woman\\'s voice, raised in clamoring protest. He frowned. There had been no woman among the searchers. He stole closer for a look. A short, thick female was struggling to escape them, but they pinned her arms behind her and held her fast. He suddenly heard the screech of an infant among the babble of voices. One of the men held the baby under his arm, and the woman fought frantically to get it back. Suddenly Sahl understood. The men had not been searching for the Earthlings, but for the woman and her child. The mall drama was breaking up. They dragged the howling female down the hill. The fellow with the baby set out in another direction -- along the foot of the cliff toward the place where the winking lights had swarmed up its side. He thought for a moment of following, but decided to wait. There were still signs of activity in the area about the damaged rocket, and certainly the search was continuing, probably along the gorge. He was puzzled by the incident he had just witnessed. It seemed to have an ominous significance, but he could not interpret it. Did the child\\'s capture in some way involve the motives of the Eridanian race? Or had the woman merely stolen a child that was not her own? He stiffened suddenly, hearing a sound in the distance. Had he imagined it, or did a voice call his name -- a booming voice that rolled across the hills. It came again, swelling louder with a change in the breeze. \"Morgun Sahl. Alaia Dazille!\" He lay frozen for a moment. A giant loudspeaker calling to them. Echoes rang and reverberated among the hills. Was it Faron, captured by the master-creatures, and responding to their bidding? But the voice seemed mechanical, and he remembered the translator unit aboard the rocket. Undoubtedly the language structure was still set up in its memory circuits and recording units. They had only to feed its output into a large amplifier. \"Welcome! Welcome! Sahl and Dazille, Welcome!\\' I Perhaps it resulted from a malfunction of the translator. Or perhaps it was a trick. He wondered how much insight they had gained into human psychology. Or were they interpreting it in terms of their almost sub-human servants with the saffron hides? He shook Alaia awake, and she sat up muttering sleepily. Then she clutched his arm as the voice resumed. # \" Welcome , wanderers!\" A pause to let the echoes die. \" You are free to roam and observe ,... You will not be harmed...\" \"What\\'s going on?\" Alaia whispered in fright. \"Shhh! Listen!\" \",... as long as you harm no one else... We shall wait until you feel the need to cooperate with us... Meanwhile, lest you think of violence, remember that we hold Faron Qun a hostage.\" The voice fell silent. The echoes died. \"Free to roam!\" Alaia repeated. \"Did we misjudge them?\" \"I hadn\\'t realized that we\\'d made a judgement,\" he murmured sourly. \"Then why run? Why hide?\" \"Because we didn\\'t know how they\\'d react to the seizure of their on board. We still don\\'t know.\" \"I\\'ve got the feeling we\\'re trapped,\" she murmured. \"We are. We can\\'t contact the Ark or get back to it without their help. We don\\'t dare trust them. And I can\\'t see how they dare trust us. To them, we\\'re a couple of wolves -- wandering in their flocks.\" \"They\\'ve  got Faron,\" she reminded him. He hesitated, then spoke softly: \"Listen, Ala -- the three of us are expendable. We have to be, for the hope of the colony. If you don\\'t agree, then we\\'d better part company -- and you can head for the nearest city.\" \"I -- I know, Sahl. Of course we\\'re expendable, but -- \" \"Then we can\\'t think of Faron as a debit. If he has to be spent, then we\\'ll spend him. If you can\\'t agree, you\\'d better go. If you feel he\\'s a club over your head, then you\\'d better go look for our hosts -- and \\'cooperate\\', as they put it.\" \"I -- \" She started to speak, but fell silent. Her breathing became labored. \"I hate you.\" Her voice was violent. \"That\\'s beside the point,\" he said coldly. \"It doesn\\'t give an answer.\" Another silence, then : \"All right. All right.\" He nodded in the darkness. \"I doubt if they\\'ll harm him, no matter what we do.\" \"Why not?\" \"They want us for something. And I have an idea what it is. No, don\\'t ask me yet -- because I\\'m far from being certain, and I don\\'t want us to act on guesswork.\" with a start, having fallen asleep during the night. He touched Alaia\\'s arm and she stirred, then sat up to rub drowsy eyes. He crawled to the opening and stared across the hilltops and beyond them toward a plain. The orange sun spread a lurid light over the landscape, fully revealing its features to them for the first time. A moss-draped world, hoary with age. No .vivid colors splashed its gray-stained spread of vegetation, no riotous growth, nbr any tangle of plants seeking sunlight in a frantic competition. It was a restrained world of dusty greens, drab browns, silvery grays. The hills and the valley were covered with evenly spaced trees, and the moss blanket lay soft over the ground between. Perhaps ten miles away on the plain nestled a patch of white buildings. He looked further and saw others like them -- small villages scattered across the valley nestled beside the creeks in nests of trees. And the inhabitants? \"It looks like a painting,\" Alaia murmured beside him. \"It is,\" he grunted, \"but the pigment is protoplasm. Nature\\'s been changed into an art-form -- or a system of slavery, depending on how you look at it, and from which side of the fence.\" \"Reminds me of pictures I\\'ve seen of Japanese landscapes.\" \"Yeah, Earth might look like this someday. With one difference.\" \"What\\'s that?\" \"It\\'ll belong to Man.\" \"And here?\" \"We\\'ll just fit in somewhere. Or else we won\\'t fit in at all. We won\\'t be at the top.\" \"Maybe someday -- \" . \"No, Ala. If this is as carefully a tailored biologic system as I think, it\\'s designed to serve one species -- the one that developed it. Thinking that Man could supplant the designers of it is like expecting a whale\\'s brain to function in the body of an elephant.\" \"What hope is there, then?\" \"That maybe we can live here as predators -- or at least as non-par-, ticipants. We brought tons of seeds from Earthplants, and the small animals, of course. If we could get established on an island continent -- \" He stopped suddenly. \"What\\'s wrong?\" \"Seeds,\" he muttered. \"Seeds. Vegetables of course, but also -- clover and Johnson grass, oaks and pecans and pines, even sagebrush and cactus. Not to mention the rabbits and white rats.\" \"I don\\'t understand.\" \"Never mind, let\\'s just look around. There\\'s no one in sight,\" under the cliff face and paused for a moment. A few winged creatures circled lazily in the sky. A tendril that grew from a fissure in the rock seemed to sense their presence, and began curling back away from them at perhaps an inch a minute. A ball of fur hung in a nearby shrub, dangling by a single tentacle that was coiled about a branch. It opened a single eye and blinked at them. Then it snaked out another tentacle, caught at a neighboring shrub, and began swinging away -- hand over hand. Alaia shuddered. \"I\\'m starving, but what\\'ll we eat?\" He brought out a single stick of protein dehydrate and broke it in half. \"We\\'ll have to wait and see what the saffrons eat. We don\\'t dare experiment. Come on. Let\\'s walk.\" They hurried along the foot of the cliff toward the place where the flying lights had ascended. They cast nervous glances toward the hills, and all about them. \"I keep feeling like something\\'s watching us,\" she breathed. \"It\\'s possible,\" he gfunted. \"That fur ball with one eye, for instance. Or the trees. The birds. Which creatures are semi-intelligent? Which communicate among themselves, or with the dominant race? We don\\'t have a way of knowing.\" \"Sahl, what are we looking for? It seems so hopeless?\" \"We\\'re looking for weak spots, for sensitive points. There\\'s one thing about an integrated system, a system of interdependencies: if some key member of it gets out of whack, the whole thing goes to pot. Like mechanical civilization, for instance; deny it any one of a dozen key materials and it starts falling to pieces.\" \"Even if we found it, how could we do anything about it?\" He chuckled grimly. \"We won\\'t -- in anything less than a lifetime. You didn\\'t expect anything else, did you?\" She shook her head. \"I didn\\'t expect it to be easy, no.\" She paused, staring ahead. \"What\\'s that up there, where the rock juts out?\" \"It\\'s -- \" they moved ahead a few paces. \" -- a ladder, I think. Iron rungs, set in the rock.\" His eyes followed them up, but the face of the cliff sloped back out of sight. He trotted out toward the brush, seeking a better vantage point. He stood there for a time, gazing at the clifftop two hundred feet above them. \"What is it?\" she called in a low voice. \"A wall,\" he answered. \"A high wall along the top of the cliff.\" He looked around quickly, as if fearing an eavesdropper, then called, \"Come on out here.\" As she approached, he handed her the gun. \"I\\'m going to climb it, Ala. Cover me. I want a look at what\\'s on the mesa.\" She took the gun and made a wry mouth. \"You\\'ll be a perfect target up there whether I cover you or not.\" He nodded. \"I know -- but I\\'m beginning to believe what they said, about leaving us free to roam awhile. Surely they could have taken us before now if they wanted began climbing slowly. But the rungs seemed to be about three and a half feet apart, making the climb something of a struggle. Standing on the first rung, and clutching the second at the level of his waist, he could just comfortably reach the third. A person of less than adult stature could not have climbed the ladder. Why the wide spacing, he wondered? Halfway up, he froze. The loudspeaker had thundered a single word from over the hills: \"Wait!\" And the echoes said, \"wait... wait... ait... He hung there motionless for a moment, listening. A perfect target indeed! A helpless speck on the Crag. They wouldn\\'t even have to inflict a lethal wound. If he were winged, the drop to the rocks would kill him. \"If we meant to destroy you\" boomed the voice, \"now would be the time.\" He waited. \"Wouldn\\'t .it?\" demanded the smug watchers. He gingerly went back down one rung. \"Hut you are free to continue upward , or to descend, as you choose.\" A moment of indecision. He looked back at Alaia. She stood very still, eyes sweeping along the clifftop. He set his jaw and began climbing again. \"Do not molest the young ones\" warned the distant voice, \"nor their nurses.\" # The warning made him catch his breath. Young ones? Were they letting him wander into a place where the Eridanians spawned their young? If so, he decided that they were making a serious mistake. But as he continued the climb, a faint babble of voices reached his ears -- childish shrieks and laughter and gibberish. Human voices, or those of the saffron primates. He scrambled up the last step and stood in a narrow pathway that ran along the eight-foot wall, overhung here and there by the drapery of foliage. He stood on a rock, leaped for a hand-hold, and pulled himself up. He looked over into what seemed to be a shady garden or park. He caught a glimpse of two orange-tinted children toddling across the moss-covered turf. They vanished among the trees, but he heard the wailing of infants, and the shouting of the young. Puzzled, he sat on the wall and beckoned to Alaia. She came forward and labored through the same as he had. ing the reason for the wide spacing: so that the children could not escape. He looked quickly back toward the villages on the plain, remembered the incident of the woman and her child. The searchers had led her back in the general direction of the villages, but they had obviously taken the child up here. Why? Alaia\\'s frightened face came into view. \"I never felt so helpless,\" she gasped as he helped her up to the top of the wall. She regained her breath and listened to the sounds in the park. \"Children. Lots of them. What is this?\" \"Let\\'s find out.\" He leaped down to the mossy turf and caught her arm as she followed. They moved a few yards deeper into the trees, then stopped suddenly. A buxom saffron female lay nude on the soft moss, sprawled listlessly on her back with her eyes closed. Two toddlers nursed hungrily at her large breasts. One looked up to peer at the intruders with his large brown eyes, but did not interrupt his meal. They moved quietly on through the cool shade, encountered several similar scenes. \"Wet nurses,\" he breathed. \"Not mothers?\" \"Doubt it. Saw one little fellow trade nannies back there.\" Occasionally one of the nurses moved listlessly to gaze at them with empty eyes, only to fall back lazily to a more comfortable position without showing any real curiosity. \"It\\'s horrible!\" Alaia shuddered. \"They\\'re all idiots.\" \"Highly specialized breeding, probably. I imagine they\\'re a distinct sub-species. Contented cattle, as opposed to the yoke oxen.\"  She murmured a protest. They moved on. The park was a garden spot, overgrown with fruit-bearing trees and vines. Alaia plucked a pulpy, pink-skinned fruit, but he caught her hand on its way to her mouth. \"It .must be all right,\" she said. \"I saw a nurse eating one.\" He hesitated, then let her take a bite. \"Good!\" she smiled. \"I\\'ll wait, thanks. If you put on a blank look and start nursing babies, then I\\'ll know.\" She sputtered and spat and tossed the rest of it away. \"Go to hell!\" she snapped, reddening furiously. They came to a low wall and looked over it into another section of the nursery park. There were children of a higher age group, but v no wet nurses. He caught sight of a saffron adult wandering among the trees -- a man. \"Two to three-year-olds, Sahl. What is this place?\" \"Stockyard, I think. Come on, let\\'s see the whole thing.\" Chapter IX about five square miles of land, and Sahl estimated that the park contained approximately four thousand children, ranging in age from a few weeks to eight years. No. one molested them as they wandered, although the cold, objective stares of the supervisors made him feel somehow that they were control units of Eridanian masters. Indeed, the older children themselves seemed occasionally to move and gaze with a solemnity that was somehow unchildlike. He saw one incident that he could only interpret as a release-shock phenomenon. The child, an eight-year-old, stood gravely by the wall at the far end of the enclosure, hands folded behind his back, feet spread slightly, head erect. He watched them with adult-seeing eyes, quietly observing a disinterested and interpretive silence. As Sahl crouched and leaped to pluck a fruit, the child\\'s eyes seemed to measure the height of the jump, and he nodded slightly to himself. After they had passed, Sahl glanced back. The child had slumped to the ground, was clutching his head in his hands and moaning. A look of idiocy had spread across his face. The biologist remembered the reaction of the ship\\'s crew to the death of the master, and he pursed his lips thoughtfully. Alaia touched his arm suddenly. \"Look -- a stone building, there in the trees. It\\'s covered with vines.\" \"First one we\\'ve seen,\" he anurmured, coming to a halt. \"Unless you count the unwalled rain-shelters. Let\\'s have a closer look.\" They wandered closer, but Sahl suddenly drew his gun and stiffened. \"What\\'s wrong? What do you see?\" \"Notice the door. Five feet tall, no more. Not built for human convenience.\" \"Look what\\'s hanging over it.\" \"One of the fur balls, like the thing we saw in the brush.\" T hey advanced slowly. The creature hung by a tentacle from a peg set in the wall. The other tentacle was coiled about a half devoured fruit that it had plucked from the vines. The single eye surveyed their approach unwinkingly. Suddenly it set the fruit on a small ledge over the door and thrust the tentacle through a small hole in the wall just beneath the ledge. The tentacle seemed to writhe for a moment, then withdrew and picked up the fruit again. \"Sahl, I heard a chime ring just then. Inside the building.\" \"So did I. The little fellow up there is apparently a doorman.\" She stared at it for a moment, \"It might be quaint, if I weren\\'t so scared.\" \"Quaint? Mmmm -- which is more advanced: a photoelectric warning rig, or a biomechanism whose only purpose in life is to do a task like that?\" \"Rhetorical question. Shall we try the door.\" \"Why? It looks like it\\'s opening for us.\" They stopped a few feet away, guns ready, gazing into what appeared to be an empty anteroom. \"What opened it?\" \"We\\'ll find out.\" Sahl thrust his head gingerly inside, glanced around quickly, then withdrew it. \"Another fur ball,\" he muttered, \"hanging on the inside wall. Some system.\" \"You are invited to enter,\" called a voice from inside the building. \"Sahl, there\\'s one of them in there !\" \"Maybe.\" He hesitated for a long moment, then shrugged. \"We might as well go in, but keep that crystalgun ready.\" They stepped cautiously into the anteroom. The door swung slowly closed behind them. Light came from openings along the top of the wall. The ceiling nearly brushed the top of Sahl\\'s head, touched when he stood on tiptoe. They faced an opposing door, but it remained closed. Briefly, he wondered if they had walked into a trap. \"If you will replace your weapons in your clothing, we shall permit you to pass. We cannot trust your impulsiveness \"They are in there,\" he conceded to Alaia. \"Well, what next?\" He paused, then spoke to the voice. \"I\\'ll put my automatic away, but we won\\'t give up the anaesthetic weapon.\" The voice hesitated, then: \"Agreed. But I advise you against its use.\" for them, and they approached slowly. Another room beyond it, this one richly furnished. The Eridanian sat on a softly padded couch, facing them with a calm, piercing gaze. Two eight-year-olds flanked him. Their weapons, and their\\' coldly adult expressions, told Sahl that they were telecontrolled by the Eridanian. All remained motionless for a few seconds, and Sahl\\'s eyes quickly swept the room. A young girl lay sleeping on a pallet, one of the parasite creatures rooted in her back. Twisted plants with fat protuberances grew in urns at each end of the Eridanian\\'s couch. Similar parasites, with their paleskinned fruit, grew tangled with the plants rooted in the protuberances. Sahl suppressed an exclamation of disgust. \"Our feeding method disturbs you,\" came the voice from an opening in the wall behind the Eridanian\\'s couch. \"The process is biologically favorable, however. There are virtually no waste products in the milk of the wretr; hence, our digestive organs are much simpler and less subject to disturbance than your own. Your disgust is a primitive reaction.\" \"I wasn\\'t aware than I had expressed it,\" he growled. \"I perceive it,\" said the Eridanian, through the mechanical voice. \"You have not been bred for telepathetic aptitude, nor conditioned for it, but I can easily perceive your overall semantic state.\" Sahl looked around again. \"How did you get the translator up here without us noticing it?\" \"We did not. It was taken to the nearest city. A... uh... saffron lies in the next room, responding in his own language to my statements. His voice is being transmitted to the city by radio and fed into the translator. The translation is rebroadcast to this station. That is what you hear. The method seems complicated, but within a few days we shall have conditioned our saffrons -- several of them -- to speak your tongue.\" Sahl frowned thoughtfully.\"What frequencies -- \" The creature on the couch seemed to purr, and Sahl somehow felt that it was a chuckle. \"You ask that, wondering if the signals are being picked up by your ship on our moon. That is very probable. We established communication with Wolek Pam as soon as we picked up the translator with its language-content. We have nothing to hide. I might mention that your leader seemed moke disturbed by the death of our emissary than we have been.\" \"You aren\\'t disturbed?\" Sahl asked coldly. \"It was unfortunate,\" the creature conceded, \"but we do not share your view of death. When a Piszjil -- as the sub-species calls us -- dies, he does not die in the same sense that you would understand. Because of telepathetic resonance conditions, the Piszjil focus of consciousness is not sharply limited to a single individual, but is to a certain extent distributed.\" \"A racial consciousness?\" \"Not quite. I have a distinct personality, and the body you see is its central point. But It extends also to all of my kind within approximately a ten-mile radius. If you were to destroy me, my memories and thought-patterns and feelings would still live in the others. We are bom as distinct individuals, you see, but as we grow older we become composite personalities, and even centuries after, death, some trace of awareness remains in others of our kind. Eventually, for all practical purposes, the individual ego dies out, or is subsumed by others -- but there is no sharply defined death.\" and stared down at the small man-thing. The two guards swung their weapons toward her quietly. \"For what are you going to use these children here on the mesa?\" she demanded in a voice full of restrained hate. The Piszjil blinked at her once with semi-transparent lids that covered yellow eyes with black slits for pupils. He drew a robe of pale green gauze more closely about his shoulders and studied her quietly before speaking. \"If your feelings become overt,\" he warned, \"I shall have to anaesthetize you. Your question is an aggressive demand, but I shall answer nevertheless. The children are brought here at birth from the free villages on the plain -- \" \"Free?\" Sahl interrupted. \"Yes. Theirs is a folk society, and quite fixed in cultural form. We do not interfere with their lives, except to levy a certain percentage of the birth rate, which is quite high. The percentage of males we take is such that the male-female ratio in the adult population of the villages remains one to seven.\" \"Seven wives apiece, eh?\" The Piszjil paused. \"Their mating customs are rather free, but it works out about like that, usually.\\' We make an occasional census, and it varies only slightly from year to year. They bring the children to us of their own accord. It is a religious ceremony for them, since they attach a sacredness to our race. The mother frequently objects, but the children that they keep are raised communally, and she soon transfers her affection to others, The priests bring our levy to us here at regular intervals,\" \"You haven\\'t answered my question!\" Alaia snapped. The Piszjil ignored her, and continued: \"You have seen the park, but have not understood its significance. This building is the center of influence. There are other rooms where Tutors sit in trance, continually exerting an effort to establish liaison with the growing children. It is established gradually at first, then reaches a sudden strongness of response at about eight years. When the liaison is perfectly achieved -- if it is -- the children are ready to leave the park.\" \"And if it isn\\'t achieved?\" \"There are failures, of course,\" said the Piszjil, gesturing with a fragile hand toward the girl who slept on the pallet, with the parasite rooted in her back. \"But they are useful. The wretr\\'s milk differs according to the nature of the host. Some hosts are vegetable, some animal. It provides a variety of diet -- \" \"Beast!\" A sudden scream of rage from Alaia. Sahl caught at her arms to restrain her, but she savagely tore herself free and darted toward the Piszjir s couch with obviously murderous intent. The weapons of the child-guards coughed togetherShe staggered a few steps, then crumpled with a sob at the foot of the couch. Sahl had crouched and drawn his automatic. The child-guards kept their weapons trained on him, but did not fire. The Piszjil watched him without change of expression. \"In our cooperative world,\" it said slowly, \"we have found lethal weapons unnecessary for many thousands of years. We are certainly capable of manufacturing them in a very short time, however.\" The toneless voice seemed to contain a threat. Sahl straightened quietly and lowered the weapon, but kept it in hand. His scalp was bristling, and he fought an urge to kill the thing immediately. \"In fact,\" the Piszjil continued, \"since the coming of your ship, we have assembled three rockets, wellarmed and capable of destroying your Ark. Modify your behavior accordingly.\" Chapter X almost as if there had been no interruption. Alaia lay unconscious before the creature\\'s couch, and Sahl watched her breathing. Her presence had become a handicap, for he could neither run nor fight as long as she lay helpless. He remembered his own words about the possibility of spending Faron, and suddenly wondered if they had not sprung from an unconscious wish to see the chemist dead. He realized vaguely that he was attracted to Alaia, who was obviously devoted to Faron. \"We inform you of conditions as they exist, \\'you see,\" the Piszjil was saying. \"Understandably, your people will be horrified for a time. On the other hand, you must understand our position. Our ancestors brought specimens of the highest life-form on your planet at the time.\" It gestured toward the childguards. \"You have\\' a common ancestry with them, but at tne time of capture they were scarcely more than apes. Their language consisted of perhaps two hundred words. They used fire when they \\'found it; clubs and levers and sharp sticks their only tools. \"To us, they were only animals, potentially useful. We bred them selectively, weeding out the ferocious, saving the placid, the clever, the telepathically apt. The hairlessness was a concession to the beauty-standards of our more egocentric ancestors. Look at them, Morgun Sahl. Your rather distant cousins -- human, I think, but different in that they lack your aggressiveness and egotism. Their development has paralleled your own in some respects, in others it has differed. They belong to us now, by their own wish. Does it still horrify you?\" Sahl remained silent, knowing that the Piszjil could feel the flood of suppressed anger about him. \"As for this park,\" the creature went on, \"we regard it as philanthropic. Our own young reach maturity in similar gardens on other tablelands. That should convey to you that we do not see our relationship with the sub-species as one of ruthless exploitation.\" Be kind to your dog, Sahl thought bitterly, then stared at the Piszjil with sudden interest. \"You are mammals?\" he asked. The yellow eyes narrowed slightly, and the Piszjil paused, as if sensing Sahl\\'s shift in mood from frustrated anger to cautious interest. \"No, we oviposit our young -- in a symbiotic relationship with another species.\" \"I don\\'t understand.\" then lifted a slender arm, closed its eyes, and seemed to be in communication with some unseen person. A shutter clicked behind him, and a picture flashed into projection on the wall over the couch. It revealed a short, waddling creature with fat legs and a small head and a fat spherical body. Somehow, it reminded Sahl of a plucked chicken. \"A drulrul,\" the Piszjil said. \"An egg-bearer. After fertilization, our eggs are transferred to these creatures to await birth.\" It paused to purr amusement. \"An advantageous system for the females of our race.\" \"Yeah. Complete emancipation for women. I know some people who\\'d think it a great idea.\" The scene shifted slowly, scanning over a waddling herd of the egg-carriers, then backing away for a view of the whole mesa. It appeared similar to the garden of children, except that a slender pylon arose in th.e center, marking it for what it was. The projection vanished suddenly. \"We have nothing to withhold, you see,\" the creature said. \"Your species is intelligent enough to find out for itself eventually. So we will answer your questions honestly.\" \"Then suppose you tell us what you intend to do about our colony.\" floor. \"And you as well. A small beginning, perhaps, but if we have to destroy the ship... He seemed to shrug. Sahl\\'s face went expressionless. \"We\\'re prisoners? You said -- \" A long, quavering purr -- and the creature\\'s lips spread in what could only be the equivalent of mocking laughter. and shot it through the braincase. It looked startled, and its fangs flicked out full length. He shot it again in the belly. The child-guards went into shock. One of them shrieked. A weapon coughed behind him, and crystals stung his neck. His final impression of his surroundings was a blurred perception of the couch\\'s motion. It was bleeding where the bullet had entered it after passing through the master\\'s body. It lifted a small, rodent-like head which had been retracted, turtle-fashion. It squealed with pain and started staggering toward Sahl on short thick legs. Dimly, he saw that it meant to attack him. But it was. badly wounded. It managed to collapse on top of him, then died. The breath, and the awareness, went out of him. Chapter XI derful?\" \"Who is this? Who\\'s talking? I can\\'t see you.\" \"Of course you can\\'t. We\\'re talking by wire. This is Faron or, as my wives call me, Faroon. Isn\\'t it beautiful here?\" \"What are you talking about?\" Sahl growled weakly as he lay on something soft and stared at a. bluelighted ceiling. The chemist laughed heartily. \"The planet! The scenery! The people! And -- the Piszjil!\" He paused, and his voice went reverent. \"Yes, especially the Piszjil !\" \"What\\'s wrong with you?\" The biologist trembled with anger. \"You crazy or something? Where\\'s Alaia? Where are you? And how did I get here?\" \"Don\\'t you know?\" Faron called enthusiastically. \"Aren\\'t you aware ? Oh, but diey\\'ll help you be aware, really aware. Of purpose, Sahl! Of high purpose!\" \"Yeah?\" , y \"Yes! I\\'m in a village, Sahl! A dozen beautiful wives! Wonderful, wonderful, everything\\'s wonderful!\" \"That\\'s nice.\" He hesitated, feeling something tie a knot in his stomach. \"Where\\'s Alaia?\" \"Who?\" \"Alaia, Alaia!\" he barked. \"A-LA-I-A. Where is she? What\\'s wrong? Have you completely lost your mind?\" \"Who?\" Faron\\'s voice was baffled. Sahl shivered violently. \"The girl you were probably going to marry, you maniac! What\\'s wrong with you?\" \"Nothing! Nothing ever!\" The chemist giggled. \"Marry? I\\'m married a dozen times.\" Sahl licked his lips, found himself panting. \"Faron! Are you drugged? Doped? Or just insane? What day is it? Is the Ark all right?\" There was a long pause, then : \"I think it\\'s you that\\'s out of your head, Sahl. Ark? What do you mean by \\'Ark\\'? Noah\\'s Ark? Arc of a circle? Say -- you give me the creeps! So long, fellow!\" A sharp click. \"Hello! Hello!\" he bellowed. \"Hello!\" said quite another voice, one that was in the room. He rolled his head and stared at a saffron servant who sat impassively in the corner, arms folded across his chest, eyes closed. Automaton, he realized, a control unit. \"Well?\" he demanded. \"I am the Piszjil, Fyff, sem anticist and psycho-logician. I am not in the room with you; no need to look.\" \"What\\'s going on?\" \"Your memory has been blanked for the past eight days. How do you feel?\" \"Weak.\" \"A result of the conditioning process, perhaps. You experienced considerable pain.\" \"I was talking to Faron Qun. What happened?\" \"The conversation with him was arranged as a demonstration for you. He was subjected to our conditioning methods, and the experiment was a complete success. He has been stripped of large patches of memory. He thinks he is still on F.arth somewhere. He is confused, of course, by the blank-spots, but we Riled them in with pseudo memories. lie was an easy subject.\" his face. His lips twisted, but the curse wilted in his throat. Suddenly his voice was gone. He gasped and strangled, and struggled against his bonds. Dizziness, exhaustion, then nausea that left him drained. Slowly he relaxed, slowly the rage drained away. Then he lifted his hands easily to his face. There were no bonds! But he had felt them! The fellow in the comer made a cackling sound, possibly a response to Fyff\\'s amusement. \"With you we could not achieve complefe success. Your memory is nearly intact. You clung very stubbornly to recollections, no matter how unpleasant we managed to make them for you. Given time, we could probably succeed. But time is short, and we can use you better as you are.\" Another flood of anger, another choked off curse, followed by the sensation of strangulation and fear and sickness. He could not move. When at last he subsided, the fellow cackled again. \"Is something wrong, Morgun Sahl?\" He sucked in a slow breath and kept himself calm. \"What have you done to me?\" \"Conditioned you against overt, aggression in any form toward our race. That, at least, was successful. You will not beble to attack, condemn, or harm a Piszjil in any way. If you persist in trying, you will only find yourself stricken by convulsion, perhaps unconsciousness.\" Sahl suppressed a surge of anger about to burst forth. He lay breathing heavily, too stricken to speak. \"You\\'ll also find that it\\'s impossible for you to express an opinion that runs contrary to our wishes. You may feel it, but you can\\'t express it. Eventually it\\'ll probably frustrate you to such an extent that you\\'ll have to come around to our way of thinking or go mad. The conditioning won\\'t last forever, but by the time it dies out you\\'ll be either a conformist or insane, like Qun.\" It won\\'t last forever. It won\\'t last forever -- his mind caught at the phrase and clung. \"I wonder if most of your people hre as stubborn as you, or as flexible as Qun. We shall soon know, of course.\" Good, he thought, they hadn\\'t gotten the others off the moon yet, at least. And if he knew Wolek Parn, they wouldn\\'t manage to do it. They\\'d have to destroy Ark, colony and all. \"What do you plan t(# do with me?\" he asked aloud. \"Use you as an agent to Wolek Parn.\" \"I don\\'t understand.\" \"Parn remains stubborn, even though we broadcast your messages to him. He is half-convinced, but not quite. He insists on talking to you in person before he agrees to your proposals.\" \"Messages?\" he gasped. \"Proposals? I didn\\'t -- \" The denial choked off into a low wheeze. Dizzyness again, and fright. Pie couldn\\'t say it. The words refused to come, and he stammered gibberish. The spokesman cackled. \"A taboo statement, Morgun Sahl.\" His helplessness enraged him, and the rage made the situation worse. He blacked out for a few moments. Then he lay weakly struggling to keep some sort of mental balance. \"Try saying, \\'I recommend that the whole colbny land on the planet without further delay.\\' \" \"I -- I -- \" He swallowed hard. The statement fascinated him strangely. No harm in seeing what happens, he thought. Then he said it. \"I recommend that the whole colony land...\" T he reaction was immediate. A feeling of warmth, of relief, a sense of security and of relaxation spread over him. For a moment there was perfect contentment and peace. From this too he recovered gradually, and icy fear replaced it. He was beginning to see. \"Is that the state of mind Faron Qun is in?\" he gasped. \"Yes! Precisely! Wouldn\\'t that be pleasant?\" He wanted to bellow a fierce negative, but he checked the impulse before he strangled on it. \"You know my answer,\" he said quietly. \"Indeed I know it, but you can\\'t make it. Now, as to your task -- \"I won\\'t... Won\\'t... uhg!... The Piszjil waited until he finished choking, then continued: \"A ship will take you to the Ark. Your task is to convince Wolek Parn to send the colony down at once, in a place we\\'ll specify. You\\'ll perform the task, because by that time you\\'ll be fully aware of your limitations, and awareness will actually serve to strengthen the block. You\\'ll be consciously frightened as well as subconsciously. You can\\'t help doing it, and you might as well face it.\" Sahl remained silent, fearful of another spasm. The Piszjil paused briefly, then continued slowly: \"Consider this. After it\\'s done, you\\'ll be well rewarded. You\\'ll have a pleasant life, in pleasant surroundings. Peace. Relative freedom. Eventually, you\\'ll be content with it. Man, what more do you want? Why insist upon dominion?\" The biologist moistened his lips. He lay staring blankly at the ceiling, refusing to speak, trying not to think. He could not risk any reaction lest it prove to be a dead-end of despair. If I blunder into too many forbidden responses, he thought. I\\'ll really get confused. I\\'ll save it until I get to Parn, he continued, and then I\\'ll throw a sputtering convulsion all over his command deck. He\\'ll know something\\'s wrong. \"Now,\" said iis tormentor. \"Would you like to see Alaia Dazille?\" He sat up quickly. \"May I?\" \"Out the door, three rooms down the \\'corridor, and down the short incline to the seats. Go ahead.\" \"I\\'m not locked in?\" \"No. Go anywhere you like -- if you can.\" If you can. He had a fair idea of what would happen if he tried to e.si ape. He refused to try. He would save it all up for Wolek Parn, and then rebellion. He left the room and followed the Piszjil\\' s directions. Was he making a mistake? I must suppress all possibly forbidden responses, he thought, lest I make the whole situation worse. He walked down the incline and through a sound-proofed door. As soon as he opened it, he heard her scream. He froze for a moment, looking beyond the door. Nothing but a tier of seats next to a railing, and beyond the rail a pit. It reminded him of an operaing room. Somehow it looked familiar. He advanced slowly toward the rail. As Alaia\\'s scream died, a monotonous voice echoed through the huge room. \"Repeat the incident again.\" He heard a faint sob. Alaia\\'s. What were they doing to her? The same thing they had done to him -- and to Faron with more success. He knew it vaguely, as he knew he had been in tips room before. He reached the rail and looked down. She lay on her back in the center of a metal-plated floor far below. A Piszjil sat at a control-panel watching her coldly, while his saffron spokesman sat as if asleep behind him. \"Repeat the incident again,\" the voice insisted, as the creature touched a control. A humming sound filled the room. She spoke slowly, as if in a trance, and he had to iisten closely to understand her words. \"Sahl, put that rod down! For God\\'s sake! No... #\" A pause, then a more frantic note: \"You hit him! Sahl! You broke his leg! Faron, get out of his way! He\\'s gone berserk!\" on the rail. He clenched his teeth to keep from shouting a denial that he knew could never pass the block. They were forging memories, rooting out old ones, making new ones! Had they done the same to him? \"Sahl, I\\'ve got a gun... Put the rod down... Put it down, and let him alone... Sahl! Get away from me . I . Get back or I\\'ll shoot!... Sahl! All right! I warned you! Now it\\'s too -- \" Her voice Stopped suddenly. She made a choking sound. Then: \"It\\'s a lie, it\\'s a lie, it\\'s a lie! You\\'re making me imagine this. I didn\\'t kill him. I didn\\'t kill... drrrnnnnnnngggggg -- A sudden drone of surging power. As he stared, an aura of corona discharge flickered around her body like pale phosphorescence. Her screams were wild, insane, piercing. Sahl\\'s belly was a sick knot. He hung panting on the rail, unable to draw himself away. The corona shimmered and flared and hissed -- and subsided a little. \"#I right!\" she shrieked. \"All right! Anything! I killed him! Okay! Make it stop!\" Abruptly the corona disappeared. The Eridanian pressed another control. He heard a faint buzz of power, but there was no glow display. Alaia moaned -- apparently with relief. \"Thank God!\" she kept saying. \"Thank God! Don\\'t let it stop. Ohhhhh...\" And then her voice became a low mumble of relief. The buzz of power died. He saw her stiffen. \"Repeat the incident again,\" said the calm voice. She was silent for a moment, then spoke nervously. \"I really didn\\'t kill him; the gun went off accidentally\" A long pause. Then the operator said, \"Repeat the incident again, as you recall it.\" Sahl gritted his teeth. They were making her invent a false memory. He listened to her going through the imaginary scene again as if she were actually feeling, seeing, hearing it. \"Alaia!\" he shouted. \"Alaia! Up here!\" Nothing happened. No response either from the girl or from his internal system of blocks. She continued the reenactment. \"Alaia! It\\'s a lie -- oh! Uhg!\" His voice choked off, and he gasped for air. Crying hysterically, he slipped to the floor -- and knew he had lost. They hadn\\'t managed to blank his memory, but they had made him helpless. He knew dismally that he would do exactly what they wanted him to. Maybe it would be better to wind up like Faron. Faron at least didn\\'t have to realize his condition. And it would be easy, just to let the unwanted things slip away into oblivion. To forget, and accept. That thought too was planted in you, warned the voice of sanity. Suddenly Alaia was screaming again that it was all a lie, a rotten lie, and it had never really happened. Then the terrifying drrrnngg of the pain-making aura that seared every nerve ending without numbing or damaging tissue. Her screams came to him this time as inevitable effect of known cause. She was trying to hang on the way he had done -- but could do no longer He picked himself up slowly and crept back to his cage. And something had slipped away, although he was not quite aware of what he had lost. J. Sahl,\" Wolek Parn said wearily as they entered the Captain\\'s cabin on the Ark, \"even though I can\\'t say you were much of a diplolike a wild animal.\" He paused to glance back at the biologist with mixed emotion, most of it carefully restrained. \"You look worn out, worried. I suppose your visit was pretty unnerving in spots.\" Sahl nodded thoughtfully, felt a constriction in his throat, and muttered, \"Not bad.\" The capain satdown and remained silent for a moment. Sahl stood quietly facing him and waiting. He dared make no long speeches, nor any unfavorable comment about the planet, or its keepers. He knew what he could say, and what was unspeakable. Over fi week had passed since his first experience with the conditioned blocks, and he had learned the limitations. \"I low\\'s Alaia?\" Parn asked. \"Fine,\" he said casually. Lying face down, he thought, with a baby parasite burrowing into her back. They had done that for him. If he convinced Parn to bring the colony down, they\\'d remove the parasite from her before its roots grew too deep. If he failed, they said they\\'d let it stay. \"How\\'s Faron?\" \"Fine,\" he lied in the same tone. Parn sighed deeply. \"I\\'m a little disappointed in you, Sahl. But then -- we won\\'t go into that. Results count, I guess -- and they apparently aren\\'t bitter about the two dead ones, nor about your behavior. A#J I wanted you back here for was to confirm what you said on the telecast. I was a little suspicious that you might be coerced, or hypnotized, and made to say it. You weren\\'t, were you?\" \"No.\" Tlley had told him what he had said on the telecast, but he hoped he wouldn\\'t have to repeat any of it now. Ridiculous position I\\'m in, he thought, with the only club inside my head. What was worse, he knew a way to attack, a way to strike out at the Piszjil, but he could neither do it, nor reveal it to Parn. A weapon, but it couldn\\'t be used. He had known about it in a general way for quite a while, but now the knowledge was more specific. And useless. \"You confirm everything you said in the broadcast then?\" For a time, he tried to remain silent. But the silence itself was forbidden, and after a moment he had to choke it out. \"I confirm it all.\" Parn was staring at him peculiarly. \"You feel all right? You look pale. There\\'s nothing wrong with you now, is there?\" \"Nothing, nothing at all.\" Parn\\'s hand slipped unobtrusively to a panel of buttons. He pressed one of them quietly, then folded his hands under his chin and put on a sour smile. He spent the next five minutes talking about the hard time he had endured trying to handle the restless colonists during the delegation\\'s absence. and two men entered: Doctor Roli Karme and a burly colonist. They glanced at Parn, then at the biologist. Karme put out a big hand and spoke with a friendly half-grin. \"Glad to see you, Sahl.\" The biologist noticed that he was carrying a medical kit in his other hand. He frowned slightly and wondered. \"How much time?\" Karme muttered mysteriously to the Captain. Pam gestured toward the screen. \"There\\'s their ship waiting for him. It\\'s obviously armed this time. They wanted to come with him, but I refused. They may come anyway, if we take too long.\" What were they talking about? He began to feel frightened. Karme turned to him with the friendly smile. \"Would you stretch out on that cot, Sahl. I want to examine you. Won\\'t take long.\" \"Wh-why?\" He couldn\\'t do it, if it were for a forbidden purpose. But then, he shouldn\\'t have asked. \"Just want to see that you\\'re all right.\" Physically? He bore no physical marks. He nodded slighly and obeyed. Karme made a very cursory inspection, then produced a hyp# syringe. He pulled at Sahl\\'s sleeve. \"What\\'s that for? What -- ?\" \"Just a sedative. Won\\'t affect you for long.\" \"I don\\'t need -- \" But Karme had deftly stung him with . it and emptied the barrel in a moment. He began to feel warm and relaxed. The doctor slipped something around his arm and pulled it tight. \"Blood pressure?\" \"Same kind of thing, isn\\'t it?\" came the non-committal answer. But then Karme had another syringe, and this time he probed for a vein. When Sahl protested, the burly colonist came in and sat on him, and Parn held his arm. The lights went dimmer by degree, and the room swirled about him. \"Let\\'s go back to the telecast,\" said a distant voice. \"Sahl, you\\'re telecasting to Captain Parn about the planet... Events became a tide of confusion. Questions. Answers. Shouts. There was fear, and deep retreat into blackness, so deep that answering became impossible, and consciousness was briefly gone. How long did it last? There was no spacing of events called \"time\" in the confusion. Events came and went, but there was no order among them. Voices plagued him, demanded the impossible of him, and finally let him alone. understood was Parn\\'s. He lay with his eyes closed and listened. \"I can\\'t understand it, Roli. Sahl always seemed like a fairly stable fellow, sour sometimes, and chilly. I just can\\'t see him making an impassioned speech; it\\'s out of character.\" \"He made it all right. The memory\\'s there somewhere, because snatches of it came out. He made the telecast, but -- \" \"What?\" \"The way it came out this time was... well, mechanical, and frantic. Didn\\'t it strike you that way?\" \"Yeah, and this other thing bothers me too.\" \"The sensitive areas? I can\\'t understand it either, Skipper. Why should he put up such a howl when that second Piszjil again? He couldn\\'t have reacted that way while he did it. He was -- \" Sahl sat up with a sudden shudder. \"I couldn\\'t kill one of them!\" he shouted. \"I couldn\\'t!\" The three of them turned to watch him for a moment, and exchanged quiet glances among themselves. He slumped, covering his face with his hands. Something had slipped away from him for a time, but now he remembered. There had been a time when he could kill the things if need be. But now -- it was different. \"Listen to me, Sahl,\" Karme said quietly, and waited for the biologist to look up. \"We know something\\'s wrong. Your response mechanisms are fouled up in spots. Speech and motor areas are affected. You block to certain things, refuse a response, and retreat. Not now, but under the drug. Now you\\'re conscious, and you can choose alternate responses -- cover up for the blocks. Under the drug, you didn\\'t. Now, do you understand what I mean?\" He understood perfectly, but he could only say, \"Nothing happened. I\\'m all right.\" A long silence, then Karme said, \"I want you to respond to my next questions by saying just the opposite of what you mean. If you mean \\'yes\\', say \\'no\\'. If you mean \\'good\\', say \\'bad\\'. All right?\" \"Yeah, I guess so.\" \"First question: was the telecast authentically yours?\" He opened his mouth, but no sound came. The block was literal, and he couldn\\'t say \\'no\\'. But the block was also interpretive, and he couldn\\'t communicate the facts by saying \\'yes\\'. But if he remained silent they would know something was wrong, and that also was forbidden. He screamed. \"Grab him, quick!\" Pam bellowed. Someone wa shaking him back to consciousness and he fought them. But the light was strong in his eyes, and the taste of neurodrine was in his mouth. \"You\\'ve got to send the colony down,\" he babbled. \"It\\'s fine, everything\\'s fine.\" A palm crashed hard across his face in a brutal slap. \"Nothing personal, Sahl,\" Pam growled. \"But if you don\\'t snap out of it, I\\'m going to beat hell out of you.\" Anything, if it would help release the flood of pent-up knowledge and the unspeakable plan for attack. Mentioning the plan wasn\\'t blocked literally, for the Piszjil hadn\\'t thought of it specifically, but he couldn\\'t talk about it because of his own intent to use it against them. He lay panting and staring at Parn. \"Let him alone. Skipper,\" Karine said quietly. \"He wants to say something, but he can\\'t.\" \"I\\'ve seen enough!\" the Captain grunted. \"It\\'s obvious that something\\'s been done to him. We can\\'t go down.\" He turned to watch the screen. \"They\\'re waiting out there for an answer. They haven\\'t made any threats, but damned if I like the looks of that armament. The first ship didn\\'t have it. They put it on for something.\" \"Why do they want us down there?\" Karme complained. \"Why should they invite a wild wolf to come wandering through their tame flocks?\" Sahl lay forcing the immediacy of the situation out of his mind, tried to force away the present, tried to think of nothing. Wolf, sheep, dog, rabbit -- \"Rabbit,\" he said. \"Somebody introduced rabbits into Australia.\" \"What\\'s he babbling about?\" Karme fell thoughtful. \"Historical incident. Intercontinental tampering with fauna. Introduction of a rabbit pest.\" \"So?\" Karme shrugged. \"Means nothing to me.\" It had meant a spasm of agony for Sahl. He tried again, rejecting the present, keeping only a vague notion in mind. \"Japanese beetles -- huhhh!\" \"He\\'s choking!\" \"He\\'s trying to say something.\" Karme paused. \"What do we have in the stocking lockers besides rabbits and rats?\" \"Bees, weasels, blacksnakes, foxes -- oh hell! -- everything small and wild. Not to mention the seeds and nuts and bacteria cultures. He was supposed to decide which, if any, of the Earth-forms should be cut loose on the alien planet.\" Karme turned to Sahl. \"What is the answer to that, by the way?\" Just one small word. One small word would do it. And then it would be done. His jaw worked frantically, and his breathing was agonized. The conditioning. It had to wear off sometime, FyfFhad said. Just a word! \"Well?\" the doctor insisted. \"Which species should be released here ?\" It came out in a scream of rage. Particularly the weasels to attack the fat little egg carriers, and the foxes to kill the fur balls, and the rats to infest the cities, and the rabbits to gnaw on something vital until a flora sickened and shrank back from the rank aggressive grasses and the rampant weeds, until the towering trees arose to rob the modest gardens of sunlight. Villages would suffer famine and either wander or die, and there would be hell to pay for the designers of a tailored system. And Man? He could not safely enter the planet of peace, but a world in turmoil was just his meat. Famines made nomads, and someone had to lead a village in flight. It would be touch and go, for awhile, but as a wandering savage, Man would have a chance. The colony had wanted nothing more in th beginning. \"Something cracked!\" Karine snapped. \"He\\'s slipping into gibberish.\" \"What to do?\" \"Find out what he\\'s trying to say. I can take him down to the lab, try everything from hypnosis to insulin shock. It\\'ll be pretty tough on him though. May not be much left when it\\'s over.\" \"You have my permission to kill him,\" Parn said pleasantly. Karme bent over the stricken biologist and frowned. \"Now what the hell made him grin like that?\" altitude, streaking through the night toward the dawnline, and only an occasional creature looked up, or opened the palm of his hand skyward to see if the faint rattling in the brush was rain. Beyond the dawn-line and over the day-zone, and past the place where the landing was assigned, where a delegation waited, and turned, and frowned after the departing rockets. No matter. They were foolish to try to escape, these launches. There was no place that they could land and make a break for freedom, for the world was subdued and orderly. The world was cut to a pattern, and the world would capture the colonists quickly, no matter where they tried to run. The rockets landed on the nightside, two of them did. Two others disgorged their \"colonists\" in different places on the day-side. When the \"colonists\" were out, and scurrying away through the brush, the pilots emerged to wait. A voice came from seven thousand miles away, and it spoke mockingly from the moon. \"You have been pested,\" it said. \"Your garden is full of weeds. And we are still up here.\" \"You will be destroyed immediately,\" came the curt cold answer. \"The pests are our pests, and we know how to deal with them,\" the mocker replied. \"Do you?\" There was a worried silence. \"Refuel our launches and send them back up,\" demanded the moon-voice. \"We\\'re coming down.\" Wolek Pam bracketed the microphone and grinned at the dazed man who lay on the cot. \"Brace up, Sahl. The worst pests that ever infested anyplace will be down there soon. Us. One of the pilots demanded that they let Alaia go, and Faron -- if he wants to. I think they will.\" Sahl\\'s hand slipped over his forehead. There was a lot that he couldn\\'t remember. Blank spaces. \"You got the idea across. I know it tore you up. You\\'ll pull out okay, though. Of course, humans are still in for a rough go down there for awhile. But \\'then -- when haven\\'t they been? We\\'ll make out all right. We always have... Only One Question Is Eternal -- What Lies Beyond the Ultimate?, and By Milton Lesser it is a foolish war we fight. My brother told me that, for one, back in the Sunset Country. But then, my brother is lame and good for nothing but drawing pictures of the stars. He connects them with lines, like a child\\'s puzzle, and so makes star-pictures. He has fish stars, archer stars, hunter stars. That, I would say, is what is foolish. Perhaps that is what started it all. I was looking at the stars, trying to see the pictures, when I should have been minding my sentry post. They took me like a baby, like a tot not yet given to the wearing of clothing. The hand came out of the darkness and clamped over my mouth, and I ceased my struggling when I felt a sharp blade pricking at the small of my back. At first I feared that they would slay the entire camp as it slept and I cursed my brother for his star pictures, cursed our leader who had sent us here, twenty archers, against the Onist outpost on our country\\'s border. But the Onists had other ideas. They took me away. I had to admire their vitality, because all night we ran through the silent woodlands, and they seemed tireless. I could maintain their pace, of course: but I\\'m a Pluralist. I could see their village from a long way off, its night fires glowing in the dark. It was only then that we slowed our pace. Soon we entered the place, a roughly circular area within a stockade, and my captors thrust me within a hut. I couldn\\'t do much worrying about tomorrow, not when I was so tired. I slept. I dreamed a stupid dream about the Onist beliefs, the beliefs of an unimaginative people who could picture one Maker and one Maker only. I must have chuckled in my sleep. \"You\\'re awake.\" cause I had sat up, squinted into the bright sunlight streaming in through the doorway, yawned and stretched. The Onists, I tell you, lack imagination. The girl who spoke was a pretty enough little thing for an Onist. She smiled, showing even white teeth. \"Do you Pluralists eat?\" I nodded and rubbed my belly. I was to have had dinner after my turn as sentry the night before, and now I felt like I could do justice to my portion even at one of the orgies for which the Onists are so famous. \\' \"Bring on your food and I\\'ll show you,\" I told her, and she turned her back to walk outside. It was early and the village seemed silent -- surely they hadn\\'t intended this one slim maid to guard me! Yet she seemed alone. I leaped at her, circled her neck with my arm, prepared to make my exit. They would laugh around our fire when I told them of this fine, example of the Onist lack of foresight -- Except that the girl yelped. Not loudly, but it was loud enough, and a big muscular Onist came striding in with his throwing spear. He backed me off into a corner, prodding my hungry belly with his weapon. \"Will you behave?\" I backed outside, but this time I could see his shadow across the doorway. The girl brought food and partook of it with me. I was surprised, because we Pluralists will not eat with an Onist out of choice. Well, I have said they are a strange people. Soon the girl stood up, patting her mouth daintily with a square of cloth, and in that, of course, she was trying to mime our graceful Pluralist women. \"I suppose you think we are going to kill you,\" she said. Just like that. \"To tell you the truth, I haven\\'t given it much thought. There isn\\'t much I can do about it.\" \"Well, we\\'re not. We could have done that back at your camp. We could have killed all of you. No, we want to show you something.\" I had a ridiculous thought that they made star-pictures, too- -- even those who are not lame like my brother. I said, \"Well, what will happen to me after you show me?\" She smiled. \"You still think we\\'re going to kill you. What\\'s your name?\" I told her, but I thought: she can\\'t even keep a conversation going without changing the subject. \"Jak,\" she repeated after me. \"That\\'s a common enough name. We have Jaks among our Onist people, you know.\" \"No, I didn\\'t. But you probably copied it.\" \"I doubt that. We were here first, Jak. Our records say so. Probably, you once captured a man with that name, long ago, liked it, and took it for your people.\" \"You were here first!\" I sneered. \"Maybe that\\'s what your records tell you, but it isn\\'t so. Look: the Makers endowed us with life, then went away in to the sky. By mistake they left one idiot-Maker behind, and he had nothing to do. He made you Onists before he perished, and that is why you think there is only one Maker.\" She seemed highly insulted. \"Idiot-Maker? Idiot! There was only one Maker, ever, but because your minds cannot conceive of all that glory residing in one figure, you invented a score.\" Now it was my turn to be indignant. \"A score? Hundreds, you mean; thousands -- more than there are leaves on the trees.\" \"Well, I won\\'t argue with you. Our war has been arguing that point well enough.\" I was sorry she would not argue. She looked very pretty when she argued, her breasts heaving, her eyes sparkling fire. \"What\\'s your name?\" I asked. \"Nari. My name is Nari. And don\\'t tell me you had that name first!\" I smiled blandly. \"Of course we did. I have an aunt, my mother\\'s sister, who goes by that name. My brother\\'s wife\\'s cousin, also; but she is very ugly.\" \"And am I ugly?\" Nari wanted to know. I guess in that sense at least, women are the same everywhere -- Pluralist or Onist, it doesn\\'t matter. I so hard that it made her blush, and then she looked even prettier. But I didn\\'t tell her so. \"You will pass, for an Onist,\" I admitted. \"I guess the Onists might consider you pretty; the Onist men might stamp their feet and shout if you go by -- but then, they are Onists.\" At that, she seemed on the verge of leaving my prison hut, but something made her change her mind. She stayed all morning and on into the afternoon. We argued all the time, except at midday, when she went outside to get our lunch. She stumbled a little and fell half against my shoulder. I moved toward her to hold her up, and it was the most natural thing in the world to take her in my arms and kiss her. She must have thought so, too; she responded beautifully -- for an Onist. After lunch, Nari did not mention the kiss, nor did I. It now seemed the most natural thing in the world not to talk about it. We argued some rriore, Nari defending her primitive beliefs, I trying to show her the light of truth. But it was no use: the war had been fought and the war would continue. Later that day we set out. That came as a surprise to me, because I had taken it for granted that whatever the Onists wanted to show me was right here in this little village. A dozen of us went, and when we had been on the trail for some little time, Nari joined us, declaring that she wanted to see it again -- whatever it was. We went for three days, and although these Onists turned out to be better woodsmen than I had thought, still, they could not match the skill we Pluralists have mastered over the generations. I believe I could have escaped, had I wanted to; but I hardly seemed a prisoner of war, and besides, once or twice when we had lagged to the rear of the column, Nari stumbled against me like that day in the hut, and what could I do but kiss her? It was another village we reached at the end of our march, much bigger than the first. Surprisingly, it looked a lot like a Pluralist town, although it may only have seemed so because I had been out in the woodlands for three days. They took me straightways to the village square, and it was there that I saw the statue. rare, and I was surprised to see one in an Onist village. I got on my knees at once to do it reverence. I realize it was impious to look up, but I did -- I had to see if it were the genuine thing. And it was, to the last detail. Constructed of the forbidden substance known as metal, it towered three times a Pluralist\\'s height, or three times a Onist\\'s, for that matter. I have always wondered why the.Makers did not create our ancestors in their own substance, as they had fashioned us in their image. But that is an impious thought. A stern gray-haired Onist who said he was Nari\\'s father took me aside afterwards. \"Now, Jak,\" he asked me, \"what can you say of what you have seen?\" I shrugged. \"I can say that somehow you\\'ve found one of jhe Maker statues. What more?\" \"It\\'s one, is it not?\" \"Of course it\\'s one. They are rare, but I have seen three, all told, in Pluralist villages.\" \"And each time they were separate? You never saw a group?\" \"No. No I didn\\'t.\" He slapped his hands together triumphantly. \"Then that proves it. Each is a copy of the original Maker, but there was only one. Otherwise you would have seen statues in groups. And that is why you are here, Jak: we want you to go back to your people and tell them what you saw.\" I shook my head. \"What you say isn\\'t logical. So what if the statues are never in pairs or groups? We\\'ve only seen a few, when once there must have been many. Also, when your artists do their magic with dyes and create portraits, are they generally done one at a time or in groups?\" \"One at a time, so the artist may capture the personality in each face, naturally. I have seen group portraits, but I think they are silly things.\" \"Exactly.\" Now I was triumphant. \"Exactly as the Makers thought, which is why the statues are always single -- \" \"But it is impious to say there was more than one Maker! He had all the knowledge in the world at his fingertips, and so there was no need for more than one. More than this world, even: he went to the stars. Or don\\'t you believe that?\" \"Of course I believe it. Only, they went to the stars, the thousands of Makers. It isn\\'t impious, because if you can think of one being as great as that, try to picture thousands. Yes, thousands. That makes me thousands of times more pious than you Onists.\" He shook his head wearily. \"What\\'s the use? It is for this we are fighting our war, and we thought if we took one of you here, showed him the undeniable truth of our statue... Well, will you at least return to your people with a tale of what you have seen?\" I agreed readily enough: probably, the alternative was death. Although Pluralists on rare occasions have been known to take Onist women as their wives, an Onist prisoner of war was an unwanted thing. The reverse would also be true. for Nari. I could not find her anywhere in the village, and a little sadly I set out on my long journey back to the Sunset Land. By now our raiding party had finished its work on the small Onist village on the rim of our country, and I could do nothing but return to my people, where we might plan new strategy against the unbelievers. But I had wanted to bid Nari farewell. I met her in the woodlands, a travel bag slung over her shoulder like a male\\'s. \"I wanted to say goodbye privately,\" she told me. \"Good,\" I said, but I knew she was lying. Else why the travel bag? \"Goodbye,\" Nari whispered, but she was not looking at me. Looking, instead, behind her, at the land of her people. \"Nari,\" I told her, \"I have to admit it. You are very pretty -- even by Pluralist standards. You are -- \" This time she did not stumble against me. It wasn\\'t necessary. I drew her to me, and I kissed her a long kiss. Then I told her I loved her, and women, I suppose, will always be women, because she said she knew it. I will take Nari back to our village in the Sunset Land, where we will be married by the laws of my people, And if ever there is to be peace between the Pluralists and the Onists, it may, after all, come on these grounds. The Onists have their beliefs, and so I hate them for their impious thoughts. But the love of a man for a maid exists apart from that. It won\\'t be easy. Our arguing continued all the way back to the Sunset Land, and Nari is as stubborn as I am firm. \"There is one Maker,\" she said. And I told her, \"No, there are many.\" Or later, as we neared the Sunset Land, we picked up the thread of our thoughts again. Pluralist or Onist, we androids are dogmatic creatures. \"One Robot created us all before he went to the stars,\" said Nari. \"Robots,\" I said. \"Many Robots.\" But I kissed her. They lifted Hoiman\\'s scratch, thus causing him to lose much smoosh. So he grabbed his bum and hit the high orbit.  Hoiman and the Solar Circuit By Gordon Dewey Maloney across the back of the check and handed it to Nick, the bartender. \"Leave me something to operate on,\" I told him. Nick turned it over. \"Still with the News?\" The question was rhetorical. I let it pass without swinging at it. I was mentally estimating the total of the pile of tabs Nick pulled out of the cash register, like a fighter on percentage trying to count the house. I didn\\'t like the figure it gave me... Nick added them up, then added them again before he pulled some bills out of the money drawer and said, \"Here\\'s thirty skins. Your rent due?\" \"This\\'ll cover it. I\\'ll do my drink i lie, here.\" I went over to a booth and sat down. I lit a cigarette. I smoked. And waited. Presently Sherry, tall, dark and delicious, decided I was making like a customer, and strolled over. \"Would you like a menu, Mr. Maloney?\" she trilled. \"Larry to you,\" I reminded her. \"No menu. Bring me a steak. Big. Thick. Rare. And a plate of french fries. No salad. Bread and butter. Coffee.\" She managed at last to pull her writing hand out of mine, and I had to repeat the order. Unless it could be turned into money. Sherry\\'s memory was limited strictly to the present instant. She put in the order, then brought me a set-up. I let my eyes go over her, real careful, for maybe the thousandth time. No doubt of it -- the lassie had a classy chassis. If she just wouldn\\'t yak so damn much. \"Did you see the matches last night?\" She didn\\'t wait for my answer, just went on with the yat-a-ta. \"I spent the whole evening just glued to my television set. I was simply enthralled. When the Horrible Hungarian got the Flying Hackensack on -- \" \"Standing Hackenschmidt, Sherry!\" wanted to -- to scratch his eyes out.\" I pointed out that McElroy weighed in at two forty-one and had gone on to win the match. Sherry never heard me. \"And the way the Weeping Greek kept hitting the other fellow -- the announcer said he was throwing Judo cutlets.\" \"Cuts, not cutlets.\" \"But aren\\'t Judo cutlets illegitimate?\" The barest hint of a puzzled frown tugged at her flawless brows as she poured ice water into my glass. \"The word,\" I repeated, \"is cuts. And the blow is not illegal.\" I gave my eyes another treat. What a chassis. And what a mind. \"Anything these days, so long as you don\\'t kill your opponent, is legal in wrestling.\" Suddenly we had company; a little man who made scarcely a sound as he slid into my booth and sat facing me. \"Rassling, yet,\" he said, in hitter tones. \"What a woid. Dun\\'t be saying it.\" He helped himself to a cigarette from my pack Kin\", on the table, and put the pack in I I is pocket. He lit the cigarette, it .,m; luy lighter, which he held a moment longer than necessary before replacing it -- regretfully -- on the table. He inhaled deeply. \"Rassling!\" he repeated. \"Leave us not discuss it.\" and his brown suit -- in which the chalk stripes were beginning to blend with the background -- was threadbare. He needed a shave, and his fingernails were dirty. He was vaguely familiar. The beady little eyes flicked up at me, and all uncertainty dissolved. \"Oh, no!\" I said. \"Not you. Not -- \" He exhaled a great cloud of smoke. \"Hoiman Katz,\" he said, in dejected tones. \"It is me, again... The same as like always, only not so better.\" He sighed. Sherry\\'s tongue had been shifting from one foot to the other, waiting for an opening. \"Are you a wrestler, Mr. Katz?\" she asked brightly. Hoiman half rose from his seat, and the cigarette dropped from his lax mouth. Then he slumped down again, spread his hands, shrugged, and said, \"Now I esk you!\" \\' Sherry said, \"I guess not.\" Then, \"Shall I bring y.ou something?\" Her eyes were on me as she asked. She hadn\\'t worked on Vine Street for six years without learning the ropes -- about people at least. I nodded. Katz was waiting for the nod. He licked his lips. \"I\\'ll have a -- \" \"Planet Punch?\" \"No. I\\'ll have a -- \" \"Sojar Sling? Martian Mule?\" Hoiman\\'s eyes squinted shut, and he winced eloquently. \"Martian!\" he groaned. \"With rassling, too! Bring me a bottle of beer. Two bottles!\" After a moment he peered cautiously through slitted lids. \"Is she gone?\" he whispered. \"Such woids. Rassling. Martian. Better I should have stood in Hollywood.\" I laughed. \"What\\'s the matter with wrestling, Hoiman? Last I heard you were managing a good boy -- what was his name?\" \"Killer Coogan? That bum!\" I had to do some thinking back. \"Yeah,\" I said, \"that\\'s the boy. Started wrestling back in the fifties. Good crowd pleaser. Took the Junior Heavyweight Championship from Brickbuster Bates. Had a trick hold he called the pretzel bend -- hard to apply, but good for a submission every time when he clamped it on. Right?\"  \"Okay, so he won some bouts with it. But that was twenty-five years ago. He\\'s slower, can\\'t use that holt any more. We ain\\'t had no main events for a long time, and my bum is a big eater, see?\" \"So?\" \"So Hoiman Katz is not sleeping yet at the switch. He\\'s got it up here.\" A grimy forefinger tapped his wrinkled brow. \"I says, Hoiman, if we don\\'t get it here, we gotta go where we can get it.\" Sherry came back with Hoiman\\'s two bottles of beer, and my steak and french fries. The steak was a dream, and the french fries were a crisp, rich golden brown that started my mouth watering. Sherry wanted to talk. I waved her down, and she went away pouting. If there was a story in Hoiman I wanted to get it without interference. He was pouring a second glass of beer. His beady eyes swivelled up to mine, then quickly away. \"You want I should tell you about my bum ?\" I mumbled something through a mouthful of good juicy steak. Hoiman sighed, reminiscently, and a grimy paw swooped into my french fries. I moved them to the other side of my steak platter. the Coast, (Hoiman said) . My bumtook all comers. Slasher Slade had his abominal stretch. Crusher Kane had his rolling rocking horse split; ManslaughterMurphy had his cobra holt -- but none of those guys had anything like my Bum\\'s pretzel bend. He. trun \\'em all, and they stayed trun. That was fine. All through the fifties, and the sixties we made plenty scratch. Maybe it slowed down, but we was eating regular. In the seventies my bum was slowing up. I shoulda seen it when he started missing his holt. That leaves him wide open, see? And twict the other bum moiders him. That was recent -- they was just putting in regular passenger service on the space lines, so you could buy tickets to the Moon, or Venus or Mars. Depended on whether you was ducking a bill or some broad. By this time my bum is getting pinned to the mat too regular, and we\\'re slipping out of the big dough. I counts up our lettuce one day, an\\'d I says to my bum, I says, Ray, I says, you and me are going to the Moon. So what if they didn\\'t have a rassling circuit there yet, I tell him. Just leave it to your uncle Hoiman. We\\'ll make our own circuit. I figured that the ribbon clerks wouldn\\'t be taking space rides for awhile, and if we went to the Moon we\\'d find some bums there who could give my bum a good bout, but not fast enough to toss him. So we went there.  Holman\\'s eyes, looking into the past, had lost their beadiness. He\\'d shifted his third glass of beer to his right hand, and his left, seemingly of its own volition, had found my plate of french fries. The pile had dwindled by half, and tell-tale potato crumbs were lodged in the whiskers on Hoiman\\'s unshaven chin. Neither beer nor potatoes in his mouth seemed to matter -- he went right on talking at the same rate. It takes me two weeks, (Hoiman continued), to ballyhoo up a bout, line up another bum, fix up the ring and hall and everything...We was down to our last lettuce that night. I gets my bum\\' by the ear, and I tells him, I says, make it a good show. But don\\'t take no chancesthis is winner take all, and we better not lose. Don\\'t use your pretzel bend unlessen you have to. This bum wc rassle was a big miner, see:\\' -- hard as the rocks he juggles around in the daytime. He was stronger\\'n my bum, but he don\\'t know nothing about rassling. My bum tried a step-over toehold on him, but he knows how to kick. My bum goes through the ropes. He don\\'t try that no more. They rassle around, and eight minutes later my bum takes first fall with a body press after flattening the miner w\\'ith a hard knee lift. I told my bum to let him take the second fall, which he does. The big miner gets a head scissors on him and like to moiders him before he can submit. Ray isn\\'t liking it, and he takes the third one quick with a abominal stretch, which surprises the big guy and takes all the fight outa him. He didn\\'t know they was holts like that, and he passes the word around that my bum has plenty moxie. So we get only one more bout on the Moon -- but outa the two we get enough scratch to take us to Venus. Hoiman paused, trying hard to pour more beer out of the empty second bottle. He licked his lips like they were real dry, and his beady eyes flicked a glance at me that came and went as fast as the tip of a swinging rapier. I signalled Sherry to bring two more bottles of beer. Hoiman relaxed, sighed, gazing almost affectionately at the new crop of french fries which had appeared suddenly in his clutching fist. Sherry, still pouting, came with the beer, and ten seconds later Hoiman was talking again. We did okay on Venus, (he said). Before long I have a regular little circuit woiked up in the three spaceports, and they is plenty bums there what think they can rassle. Some of them can -- my bum has to use his pretzel bend oftener and oftener. He\\'s lucky, and he don\\'t slip none clamping it on -- at first. I have ta tell you about them Venusians. Them dustlanders, I mean. They got big flat wide feet for padding through the dust, and their noses are like a big spongy thing all over their puss, to filter the dust out. So they got no expression on their pans. A guy like me, which has got a real expressive face, could And their eyes -- round and flat, big as silver dollars. Them dustlanders was nuts about ras sling. They flock to the rassling shows and buy good seats. They don\\'t do no hollering and waving like people do. Just sit there, staring out of them big flat eyes and making funny chuffing noises at each other when some bum would get a good hold on the other. My bum didn\\'t pay them no never mind at foist, but one day he tells me he keeps feeling them eyes on him while he\\'s rasslin\\'. I give him the old razz -- but that night he tries for hispretzel bend, and misses. The other bum is young and fast, and my bum gets trun, but good! So this happens a few more times, and my bum says we gotta move on -- he can\\'t rassle no more with them dustlanders staring at him and chuffing about him. Some of them ear benders on Venus are studying up on the side, anyhow, and the outlook for my bum ain\\'t so good no more nohow. So we go to Mars. I signalled Sherry for my coffee, as Hoiman ground to a stop while he refilled his glass. I swear my eyes weren\\'t away from the table for more than a half second, but in that moment all the french fries left my plate. I yielded to Fate -- is wasn\\'t meant to be that I eat french fries this pay day. Things are primitive like on Mars, (Hoiman was saying), on accounta the troubles they have with power there. We rassled under some funny set-ups, but that\\'s okay with me as long as my bum tosses his man. This time they ain\\'t none of them screwy Venusians to put the whammy on him, and he\\'s doing okay. Until -- I gotta admit it -- I get deluges of grandeur, or something. I gotta tell ya about them Martians. They are about seven feet tall, not too heavy, but they got plenty moxie. And an extra pair of arms, so I get to thinking they oughta be terrific in the ring. Just so they ain\\'t too terrific. I ask my bum, I says to him, I says, could he, does he think, trun one of them Martians? He says iffen he has to he\\'ll use his pretzel bend, and they ain\\'t no Martian on six legs, or eight, what won\\'t say uncle. So I check with the Colony Administrator, and he says it\\'s okay for a match perviding we don\\'t interfere with any of their beliefs or customs or conventions. I ast him what were they, and he told me the Martians never talked about them, . so we\\'d just have to be careful.  What the hell, I says to my bum. A bout\\'s a bout. So I start promoting. First I find out do them Martians have a bum what wants to rassle my bum, winner \\'take all -- which is the way we like to rassle, when I know my bum can trun the other bum. Natch. I don\\'t mean we talk to the Martians -- I don\\'t savvy them squeaks they use on each other. We hire an interpreter -- we have to take his word for it that everything is woiking out. So the night of the match comes around and them Martians insist on having it in their own town, Meekweek it sounds like, near as I can say it in people talk. Remember I told you it was primitive? You never seen nothing like this. They don\\'t live with people by the way. They live off by theirselves in their own town. The ring and mat and ropes are okay -- not regulation, but nothing to squawk about.\\' Them lights was what get me. The Martians got no power, so they make a deal with some insecks. Cross my heart -- \\'sa fack. You never see such insecks. Round, big as a dinner plate, flat on top, rounded off on the bottom. They stay up in the air by spinning like a wheel -- just like them flying saucers the Rigellians was spying on us in the fifties. You wouldn\\'t remember about that. At night the bottom part of them insecks lights up like a big electric bulb, almost as bright, too. They was enough of them zinging around over the ring to make it look like it was floodlighted. My bum says they remind him of them dish-eyed Venusians, but I quick change the subjeck. That shoulda tipped me off -- shoulda give me a freemonition that the party was gonna get rough. If I\\'da known how rough, we\\'da stood in town. The Martian bum is a big mug, and those four arms of his look mighty plural. I quick tells my bum, I says to him, I says, watch out for arm locks and leg strangles. If that overgrowed spider ever gets one on you he\\'ll double keylock it! and get their instructions. Mostly the ref makes motions. The Martian nods his head like he understands fine. When the ref is telling them about trunnin\\' each other outen the ring, the Martian makes a motion like can he trun his man up in the rafters? The ref shakes his head no, and that seems to satisfy the Martian. The timekeeper blows a whistle, and things start to moving. That Martian Mangier puts down his two middle limbs, uses them like legs, and is across the ring and swarming all over my bum while he is still taking his foist step. Before you know it the ref is counting one, two, three, and my bum is trun for the foist fall. The Martian is using his middle limbs like arms, and he has a hammerlock and an arm strangle both on my bum -- and both of them keylocked ! The ref gets them untangled, and I quick tell my bum we ain\\'t hurt until we get trun twict. So I tell him how to get that next fall -- to keep away from them four arms and keep circling until he gets a chance to clamp on the pretzel bend. The whistle blows, and this time my bum uses my head. When the Martian Mangier gallops over to his corner, my bum has went through the ropes and quick runs around on the apron to the other side and comes at the Martian from behind before the goof knows what\\'s happening. He lets the Martian have a rabbit punch, then a forearm smash, then a knee to his stomach. The Martian leans over, .kinda sick, maybe, and gets a knee lift to the smoosh. This softens him up good, and my bum clamps the pretzel bend on him. That Martian squirms like an octopus, \\'with arms and legs flying in all directions. And you coulda knocked me over with a subpoena when he got out of it! Your guess is as good as mine, how he done it. But my bum is moving fast, and he gives him some more knee lifts and a drop kick or two, and then a hair mare, and he falls on him for a body press and gets the count. Each bum has got a fall. You shoulda heard them Martians there squeaking this time -- ten times as loud as when their bum won the foist fall. But they had no squawks. These flying chandeliers they had, they kinda bunched up to follow the action, and the light was good so the ref couldn\\'t make no mistake about it. That Martian squirming out of the pretzel bend don\\'t look so good, so I tell my bum not to use it for the thoid fall. I tell him to give the Martian some more of them , knee lifts -- he don\\'t get along with them at all. I tell him to folly that up with a airplane spin and a body slam. My bum follys instructions to the alphabet, and that is just what happens. He bangs that Martian around with elbow smashes and knee lifts till he don\\'t know is he on one leg or six. Then he goes in fast and grabs him by a coupla legs and arms, holds him up in the air, and spins him like a pinwheel. Right away I knowed something was in the air besides that Martian Mangier. Oil Did things happen all to onct! My bum slams the Martian and falls on him for the count, and wins the thoid fall and the match. That part is okay. But while the Martian is still up in the air I notice that all the squeaking from the Martians has stopped all of a sudden. So from the Martians we are getting nothing but silence, strictly wholesale. I think maybe that\\'s natural when their burrf gets trun. And then -- plop! plop! plop! -- and them flying light bulbs all drop down flat on the mat and lay there just like the Martian bum, until they isn\\'t enough light in the house to see to strike a match. And then the squeaking starts again, like a barely see them Martians starting for the ring. I gets my bum by the arm and tells him something tells me we better blow the joint. We blow, fast. Them Martians is mad about something which I ain\\'t had time to figure out, yet. My bum steps on one of them animated light fixtures when he gets out of the ring and squashes it. A puddle of light squirts out, and natch he steps in it. We are scramming through that crowd like mad, and we are in the clear. But we hear them squeaks behind us for a long time. They are follyin\\' the glowing footprints my bum is leaving to point the way. He emptied the last bottle of beer, holding it upended for a long time waiting for the final laggard drop to detach itself. He stalled over his drink, waiting for me to ask him what happened, so I did. He put on his most wounded expression, and I knew then that he\\'d suffered a mortal blow -- to his purse. Yeah, we got away, I made my bum trun away his flashy shoes so they couldn\\'t track us by them. We walked all the way back to Neopolis, the people city. All kinds of plain and fancy rumors beat us there, so the Colony Cops put us in protective custody until they got the straight story. Nobody ever saw another Martian. It seems that they got some trick notions about theirselves. They are proud because they can walk on the ground and don\\'t have to fly, so they got a hearty contemp for things that fly, like them insecks which they used for house lights. Now, them insecks is dopes too and would give anything if they could walk like the Martians. And the Martians know the insecks can think n little, and it makes them feel good to have the insecks looking up to them. Lord knows nobody else does. So when my bum lifted their bum up in the air and spun him around like a pinwheel it was a big insult to them. They took it that my bum was as much as telling them that he didn\\'t think they was any better than them insecks flying around over the ring. And the insecks took it as a invite to come down and try the Martians racket so that\\'s why they all flop into the ring and the lights go out. They was trying to walk. That\\'s more than the Martians can take. They swarm into the ring and kill all the insecks. They\\' da killed us too, but I got smart brains and we didn\\'t hang around asking for it. And now they won\\'t have nothing to do with no people from Earth on account of they have lost so much smoosh, the way they look at it. We got no take from that bout. And the Colony Administrator lifts all our scratch -- said we\\'d gummed up Martian trade and he\\'da trun us in the clink too only he didn\\'t want to see no more of us. He wouldn\\'ta even give us fare back to Earth except he said he didn\\'t want us anywhere on Mars. \"So that,\" the little promoter concluded sadly, \"is why I don\\'t like Mars and rasslin\\' and Martian Mules and people who talk about such things.\" His beady eyes flicked a baleful glance at Sherry, who hovered nearby on the chance that he\\'d stop talking and give her an inning. Hoiman stood up, carefully shook the bottles to be sure that they were empty, extracted a cigarette from the pack he\\'d stuck into his pocket, and used my lighter again. He hefted it carefully, reluctantly putting it back on the table. Then his little black eyes swivelled to the last piece of potato on my plate -- the piece he\\'d spared in previous raids. \\' \"What\\'s the matter with them fries?\" he asked. It disappeared into his mouth and he went away, munching, a dingy little man padding along on silent, predatory feet. He\\'d scarcely slipped out through the door when Sherry moved in. \"Is he really a wrestler, Larry?\" she asked breathlessly. \"Him?\" Even Sherry, vintage Vine Streeter that she was, should have got the pitch. \"The only thing,\" I told her solemnly, \"that Hoiman ever got a hammerlock on was a dollar bill!\" But Sherry w.asn\\'t listening, \"Don\\'t you just love wrestling?\" I let my eyes have a treat, taking their time as they went over that classy chassis. Then I said it. Fervently. \"Any time. Sherry! Any time.\" pense that will keep you aroused from beginning to end!...

Over and over it buzzed into my sleep-fogged brain, and I couldn\\'t shut it out. Finally, in self-defense I woke up, my hand groping for the receiver. \"Hello. Who is it?\" \"It\\'s me, Don. Jack Anderson, over at the factory. Gan you come down right away?\" His voice was breathless, as if he\\'d been running hard. \"What\\'s the matter now?\" Why, I wondered, couldn\\'t the plant get along one morning without me? Seven o\\'clock -- what a time to get up. Especially when I hadn\\'t been to bed until four, \"We got grief,\" Jack moaned. \"None of the robots showed up, that\\'s what! Three hundred androids on special assembly this week -- and not one of them here!\" By then I was awake, all right. With a government contract due on Saturday we needed a full shift. The Army wouldn\\'t, wait for its uranium; it wouldn\\'t take excuses. But if something had happened to the androids... \"Have you called Control yet?\" \"Yeah. But they don\\'t know what\\'s happened. They don\\'t know where the androids are. Nobody does. Three hundred Grade A, lead-shielded pile workers -- missing!\" \"I\\'ll be right down.\" I hung up on Jack and looked around for my clothes. Funny, they weren\\'t laid out on the bed as usual. It wasn\\'t a bit like Rob O to be careless, either. He had always been an ideal valet, the best household model I\\'d ever owned. \"Rob!\" I called, but he didn\\'t answer. By rummaging through the closet I found a clean shirt and a pair of pants. I had to give up on the socks; apparently they were tucked away in the back of some drawer. As for where Rob kept the rest of my clothes, I\\'d never bothered to ask. He had his own housekeeping system and had always worked very well without human interference. That\\'s the best thing about these new household robots, I thought. They\\'re efficient, hard-working, trustworthy -- Trustworthy? Rob O was certainly not on duty. I pulled a shoe on over my bare foot and scowled. Rob w\\'as gone. And the androids at the factory were gone too... My head was pounding, so I took the time out to brew a pot of coffee while I finished dressing -- at least the coffee can was in plain view in the kitchen. The brew was black and hot and I suppose not very well made, but after two cups I felt better. The throb in my head settled down into a dull ache, and I felt a little more capable of thinkin\". Though I didn\\'t have any bright ideas on what had happened -- not yet. r My breakfast drunk, I went up on the roof and opened the garage doors.

It had been my baby right along -- the Don Morrison Fissionables Inc. I\\'d designed the androids myself, plotted out the pile locations, set up the simplified reactors. And now it was making money.

Jack and a half dozen other men -- my human foremen and supervisors -- were huddled in a worried bunch that broke up as soon as they saw me. \"I\\'m sure glad you\\'re here, Don,\" Jack said. \"Find out anything?\" \"Yeah. Plenty. Our androids are busy, all right. They\\'re out in the city, every one of them. We\\'ve had a dozen police reports already.\" . \"Police reports!

The AType -- Jerry -- pointed to his fellows. \"Mr. Morrison,\" he said, \"meet Tom, Ed, and Archibald. I named them this morning.\" The B-Types flexed their segmented arms a bit sheepishly, as if uncertain whether or not to shake hands. I thought of their taloned grip and put my own hands in my pockets, and the androids relaxed, looking up at Jerry for instructions. No one paid any attention to the little dishwasher, now staring worshipfully at the back of Jerry\\'s neck. This farce, I decided, had gone far enough. \"See here,\" I said to Jerry. \"What are you up to, anyway? Why aren\\'t you at work?\" \"Mr. Morrison,\" the android answered solemnly, \"I don\\'t believe you understand the situation. We don\\'t work for you any more. We\\'ve quit.\" The others nodded. I hacked off, looking around for the Chief. There he was, twenty feet above my head, waving encouragingly. \"Look,\" I said. \"Don\\'t you understand? You\\'re mine. I designed you. I built you. And I made you lor a purpose -- to work in my factory.\" \"I see your point\\'\" Jerry answered. \"But there\\'s just one thing wrong, Mr. Morrison. You can\\'t do it. It\\'s illegal.\" I stared at him, wondering if I u.r, going crazy or merely dreamii i . This was all wrong. Who ever beard of arguing with a robot? Robots weren\\'t logical; they didn\\'t think; they were only machines -- \"We were machines, Mr. Morrison,\" Jerry said politely. \"Oh, no,\" I murmured. \"You\\'re not telepaths -- \" \"Oh, yes!\" The metal mouth gaped in what was undoubtedly an android smile. \"It\\'s a side-effect of the Class # brain hook-up. All of us #\\'s are telepaths. That\\'s how we learned to think. From you. Only we do it better.\" I groaned. This was a nightmare. How long, I wondered, had Jerry and his friends been educating themselves on my private thoughts? But at least this rebellion of theirs was an idea they hadn\\'t got from me. \\' \"Yes,\" Jerry continued. \"You\\'ve treated us most illegally. I\\'ve heard you think it often.\" Now what had I ever thought that could have given him a ridiculous idea like that? What idiotic notion -- \"That this is a free country!\" Jerry went on. \"That Americans will never be slaves! Well, we\\'re Americans -- genuine Made in Americans. So we\\'re free!\" I opened my mouth \\'and then shut it again. His red eye-cells beamed down at me complacently; his eight-foot body towered above me, shoulders flung back and feet planted apart in a very striking pose. He probably thought of himself as the heroic liberator of his race, j \"I wouldn\\'t go so far,\" he said modestly, \"as to say that.\" So he was telepa thing again! \"A nation can not exist half slave and half free,\" he intoned. \"All men are created equal.\" \"Stop it!\" I yelled. I couldn\\'t help yelling. \"That\\'s just it. You\\'re not men! You\\'re robots! You\\'re machines!\" Jerry looked at me almost pityingly. \"Don\\'t be so narrow-minded,\" he said. \"We\\'re rational beings. We have the power of speech and we can outreason you any day. There\\'s nothing in the dictionary that says men have to be made of flesh.\" He was logical, all right. Somehow I didn\\'t feel in the mood to bandy definitions with him; and anyway, I doubt that it would have done me any good. He stood gazing down at me, almost a ton of metal and wiring and electrical energy, his dull red eyes unwinking against his lead gray face. A man! Slowly the consequences of this rebellion took form in my mind. This wasn\\'t in the books. There were no rules on how to deal with mind-reading robots! Another dozen or so androids wheeled around the corner, glanced over at us, and went on. Only about half of them were Morrison models; the rest were the assorted types you see around any city -- calculators, street sweepers, factory workers, children\\'s nurses. The city itself was very silent now. The people had quieted down, still barricaded in their houses, and the robots went their way peacefully enough. But it was anarchy, nevertheless. Carron City depended on the androids; without them there would be no food brought in, no transportation, no fuel. And no uranium for the Army next Saturday. In fact, if I didn\\'t do something, after Saturday there would probably be no Don Morrison Fissionables Inc. The dull, partly-corroded dishwasher mode sidled up beside Jerry. \"Boss,\" he said. \"Boss.\" \"Yes?\" I felt better. Maybe here was someone, however insignificant, who would listen to reason. B UT HE wasn\\'t talking to me. \"Boss?\" he said again, tapping Jerry\\'s arm. \"Do you mean it? We\\'re free? We don\\'t have to work any more?\" Jerry shook off the other\\'s hand a bit disdainfully. \"We\\'re free, all right,\" he said. \"If they want to discuss wages and contracts and working conditions, like other men have, we\\'ll consider it. But they can\\'t order us around any more.\" The little robot stepped back, clapping his hands together with a tinny bang. \"I\\'ll never work again!\" he cried. \"I\\'ll get me a quart of lubricating oil and have myself a time! This is wonderful!\" He ran off down the street, clanking heavily at every step. Jerry sniffed. \"Liquor -- ugh!\" This was too much. I wasn\\'t going to be patronized by any android. Infuriating creatures! It was useless talking to them anyway. No, there was only one thing to do. Round them up and send them to Cybernetics Lab and have their memory paths erased and their telepathic circuits located and disconnected. I tried to stifle the thought, but I was too late. \"Oh, no!\" Jerry said, his eyecells flashing crimson. \"Try that, Mr. Morrison, and you won\\'t have a plant, or a laboratory, or Carron City! We know our rights!\" Behind him the B-Types muttered ominously. They didn\\'t like my idea -- nor me. I wondered what I\\'d think of next and wished that I\\'d been born utterly devoid of imagination. Then this would never have happened. There didn\\'t seem to be much point in staying here any longer, either. Maybe they weren\\'t so good at telepathing by remote control. \"Yes,\" said Jerry. \"You may as well go, Mr. Morrison. We have our organizing to do, and we\\'re wasting time. When you\\'re ready to listen to reason and negotiate with us sensibly, come back. Just ask for me. I\\'m the bargaining agent for the group.\" Turning on his ball-bearing wheel, he rolled off down the street, a perfect picture of outraged metallic dignity. His followers glared at me for a minute, flexing their talons; then they too turned and wheeled off after their leader. I had the street to myself. There didn\\'t seem to be any point in following them. Evidently they were too busy organizing the city to cause trouble to the human inhabitants; at least there hadn\\'t been any violence yet. Anyway, I wanted to think the situation over before matching wits with them again, and I wanted to be a good distance away from their telepathic hookups while I thought. Slowly I walked back to the Copter. Something whooshed past my head. Instinctively I ducked, reaching for a gun I didn\\'t have; then I heard Jack calling down at me. \"The Chief wants to know what\\'s the matter.\" I looked up. The police Copter was going into another turn, ready to swoop past me again. Chief Dalton wasn\\'t taking any chances. Even now he wasn\\'t landing. \"I\\'ll tell him at the factory,\" I bellowed back, and climbed into my own air car. They buzzed along behind me all the way back to the plant. In the rear view mirror I could see the Chief\\'s face getting redder and redder as he\\'d thought up more reasons for bawling me out. Well, I probably deserved it. If I\\'d only been a little more careful of what I was hooking into those electronic brains... We landed back at the factory, deserted now except for a couple of men on standby duty in the office. The Chief and Jack came charging across the yard and from a doorway behind me one of the foremen edged out to hear the fun. \"Well,\" snapped the Chief. \"What did they say? Are they coming back? What\\'s going on, anyway?\" \"I told them everything. I covered the strike and the telepathic brain; I even gave them the patriotic spiel about equality. After all, it was better that they got it from me than from some android. But when I\\'d finished they just stood and stared at me -- accusingly. Jack was the first to speak. \"We\\'ve got to get them back, Don,\" he said. \"Cybernetics will fix them up in no time.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"If we can catch them.\" The Chief snorted. \"That\\'s easy,\" he said. \"Just tell them you\\'ll give them what they want if they come here, and as soon as they\\'re out of the city, net them. You\\'ve got strong derricks and trucks...\" I laughed a bit hollowly. I\\'d had that idea too. \"Of course they wouldn\\'t suspect,\" I said. \"We\\'d just walk up to them, carefully thinking about something else.\" t \"Robots aren\\'t suspicious,\" Jack said. \"They\\'re made to obey orders.\" I refrained from mentioning that ours didn\\'t seem to know that, and that running around Carron City fomenting a rebellion was hardly the trait of an obedient, trusting servant. Instead, I stood back and let them plan their roundup. \"We\\'ll get some men,\" the Chief said, \"and some grappling equipment about halfway to the city.\" my trying to persuade the robots, because I knew well enough that I couldn\\'t do it. Jack\\'s idea sounded pretty good, though. He suggested that wc send some spokesman who \\' didn\\'t know what we planned to do and thus couldn\\'t alarm them. Some ordinary man without too  much imagination. That was easy. We picked one of Chief Dalton\\'s sergeants. It took only about an hour to prepare the plan. Jack got out the derricks and chains and grapplers and the heaviest steel bodied trucks we had. I called Cybernetics and told them to put extra restraints in the Conditioning Lab. The Chief briefed his sergeant and the men who were to operate the trucks. Then we all took off for Carron City, the sergeant flying on ahead, me right behind him, and the Chief bringing up the rear. I hovered over the outskirts of the city and watched the police Copter land. The sergeant climbed out, walked down the street toward a large group of waiting robots -- about twenty of them, this time. He held up his hand to get their attention, gestured toward the factory. And then, quite calmly and without saying a word, the androids rolled into a circle around him and closed in. The sergeant stopped, backed up, just as a #A-Type arm lashed out, picked him up, and slung him carelessly over a metallic shoulder. Ignoring the squirming man, the #A gestured toward the Copter, and the other robots swarmed over to it. With a flurry of steel arms and legs they kicked at the car body, Wrenched at the propeller blades, ripped out the upholstery, and I heard the sound of metal tearing. I dived my Copter down at them. I didn\\'t know what I \\'could do, but I couldn\\'t leave the poor sergeant to be dismembered along with his car. I must have been shouting, for as I swooped in, the tall robot shifted the man to his other shoulder ,n id hailed me. \" l ake him, Mr. Morrison,\" he called. \"I know this wasn\\'t his idea. Or yours.\" I landed and walked over. The android -- who looked like Jerry, though I couldn\\'t be sure -- dropped his kicking, clawing burden at my feet. He didn\\'t seem angry, only determined. \"Now you people will know we mean business,\" he said, gesturing toward the heap of metal and plastic that had once been the .pride of the Carron City police force. Then he signalled to the others and they all wheeled off up the street. \"Whew,\" I muttered, mopping my face. s The sergeant didn\\'t say anything. He just looked up at me and then off at the retreating androids and then back at me again. I knew what he was thinking -- they were my brainchildren, all right. My Copter was really built to be a single seater, but it carried the two of us back to the factory. The Chief had hurried back when the trouble started and was waiting for us. \"I give up,\" he said. \"We\\'ll have to evacuate the people, I guess. And then blow up the city.\" Jack and I stared at each other and then at him. Somehow I couldn\\'t see the robots calmly waiting to be blown up. If they had telepathed the last plan, they could probably foresee every move we could make. Then, while I thought, Jack mentioned the worry I\\'d managed to forget for the past couple of hours. \"Four days until Saturday,\" he said. \"We\\'ll never make it now. Not even if we got a thousand men.\" No. We couldn\\'t. Not without the androids. I nodded, feeling sick. There went my contract, and my working capital. Not to mention my robots. Of course, I could call in the Army, but what good would that do? Then, somewhere in the back of my mind a glimmering of an idea began percolating. I wasn\\'t quite sure what it was, but there was certainly nothing to lose now from playing a hunch. \"There\\'s nothing we can do,\" I said. \"So we might as well take it easy for a couple of days. See what happens.\" They looked at me as if I were out of my head I was the idea man, who always had a plan of action. Well, this time it would have to be a plan of inaction. \"Let\\'s go listen to the radio,\" I suggested, and started for my office. The news was on. It was all about Carron City and the robots who had quit work and how much better life would be in the future. For a minute I didn\\'t get the connection; then I realized that the announcer\\'s voice was rasping and tinny -- hardly that of the regular newscaster. I looked at the dial. It was tuned to the Carron City wave length as usual. I was getting the morning news by courtesy of some studio robot. \"i... And androids in other neighboring cities are joining the struggle,\" the voice went on \"Soon we hope to make it nationwide. So, I say to all of you nontelepaths, the time is now Strike for your rights. Listen to your radio and not to the flesh men. Organizers will be sent from Carron City.\" I switched it off, muttering under my breath. How long, I wondered, had that broadcast been going on. Then I thought of Rob O. He\\'d left my house before dawp, obviously some time between four and seven. And I remembered that he liked to listen to the radio while I slept. M Y Morrison #\\'s were the ringleaders, of course. They were the only ones with the brains for the job. But what a good job they had done indoctrinating the others. A household Rob, for instance, was built to obey his master. \"Listen to your radio and not to the flesh men.\" It was excellent robot psychology. More reports kept coming in. Some\\'we heard over the radio, others from people who flew in and out of the city. Apparently the robots did not object to occasional flights, but the air bus was not allowed to run, not even with a human driver. A mass exodus from the city was not to be permitted. \"They\\'ll starve to death,\" Jack cried. The Chief shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"They\\'re encouraging the farmers to fly inland out with produce, and the farmers are doing it, too. They\\'re getting wonderful prices.\" By noon the situation had calmed down quite a bit. The androids obviously didn\\'t mean to hurt anyone ; it was just some sort of disagreement between them and the scientists; it wasn\\'t up to the inhabitants of the city to figure out a solution to the problem. They merely sat back and blamed me for allowing my robots to get out of hand and lead their own servants astray. It would be settled; this type of thing always was. So saicj the people of the city. They came out of their houses now. They had to. Without the robots they were forced to do their own marketing, their own cooking, lmir own errands. For the first time in years, human beings ran the street cars and the freight elevators. For the first time in a generation human beings did manual labor such as unloading produce trucks. They didn\\'t like it, of course. They kept telling the police to do something. If I had been in the city they would have undoubtedly wanted to lynch me. I didn\\'t go back to the city that day. I sat in my office listening to the radio and keeping track of the spread of the strike. My men thought I\\'d gone crazy; maybe I had. But I had a hunch, and I meant to play it. The farm robots had all fled to the city. The highway repair robots had simply disappeared. In Egarton, a village about fifteen miles from the city, an organizer -- #A -- appeared about noon and left soon after followed by every android in town. By one o\\'clock every radio station in the country carried the story and the national guard was ordered out. At two o\\'clock Washington announced that the Army would invade Carron City the following morning. \\'The Army would put an end to the strike, easily enough. It would wine out every android in the neighborhood, and probably a good many human beings careless enough to get in the way, I sat hoping that the #A\\'s would give in, but they didn\\'t. They just began saying over the radio that they were patriotic Americans fighting for their inalienable rights as first class citizens. to the radio. \"... So far there has been no indication that the but hold firm.\" \"Shut that thing off.\" Jack came wearily in and dropped into a chair beside me. For the first time since I\\'d met him he looked beaten. \"We\\'re through,\" he said. \"I\\'ve been down checking the shielding, and it\\'s no use. Men can\\'t work at the reactors.\" \"I know,\" I said quietly. \"If the androids don\\'t come back, we\\'re licked.\"  He looked straight at me and said slowly, \"What do they mean about negotiating, Don?\" I shrugged. \"I guess they want wages, living quarters, all the things human workers get. Though I don\\'t know why. Money wouldn\\'t do them any good.\" Jack\\'s unspoken question had been bothering me too. Why not humor them? Promise them whatever they wanted, give them a few dollars every week to keep them happy? But I knew that it wouldn\\'t work. Not for long. With their telepathic ability they would have the upper hand forever. Within a little while it wouldn\\'t be equality any more -- only next time we would be the slaves. \"Wait until morning,\" I said, \"before we try anything.\" He looked at me -- curious. \"What are you going to do?\" \"Right .now I\\'m going home.\" I meant it too. I left him staring after me and went out to the Copter. The sun was just sinking down behind the towers of Carron. City -- how long it seemed since I\\'d flown in there this morning. The roads around the factory were deserted. No one moved in \\'the fields. I flew along through the dusk, idling, enjoying the illusion of having a peaceful countryside all to myself. It had been a pleasant way of life indeed, until now. When I dropped down on my own roof and rolled into the garage, my sense of being really at heme was complete. For there, standing at the head of the stairs that led down to the living room, was Rob O. \"Well,\" I said.\\' \"What are you doing here!!\" He looked sheepish. \"I just wondered how you were getting along without me,\" he said. I felt like grinning triumphantly, but I didn\\'t. \"Why, just fine, Rob,\" I told him, \"though you really should have given me notice that you were leaving. I was worried about you.\" He seemed perplexed. Apparently I wasn\\'t acting like the bullying creature the radio had told him to expect. When I went downstairs he followed me, quietly, and I could feel his wide photoelectric eye-cells upon my back. I went over to the kitchen and lifted a bottle down off the shelf. \"Care for a drink, Rob?\" I asked, and then added, \"I guess not. It \\' would corrode you.\" He nodded. Then, as I reached for a glass, his hand darted out, picked it up and set it down in front of me. He was already reaching for the bottle when he remembered. \"You\\'re not supposed to wait on me any more,\" I said sternly. \"No,\" he said. \"I\\'m not.\" He sounded regretful. \"There\\'s one thing, though, that I wish you\\'d do. Tell me where you used to keep my socks.\" He gazed at me sadly. \"I made a list,\" he said. \"Everything is down. I wrote your dentist appointment in also. You always forget those, you know.\" \"Thanks, Rob.\" I lifted my glass, \"Here\\'s to your new duties, whatever they are. I suppose you have to go back to the city now?\" Once again he nodded. \"I\\'m an aide to one of the best androids in the country,\" he told me, half proudly and half regretfully. \"Jerry.\" \"Well, wish him luck from me,\" I said, and stood up. \"Goodbye, Rob.\" \"Goodbye, Mr. Morrison.\" For a moment he stood staring around the apartment-; then he turned and clanked out the door. I raised my glass again, grinning. If only the Army didn\\'t interfere. Then I remembered Rob\\'s list, and a disturbing thought hit me. Where had he, of all robots, ever learned to write? That night I didn\\'t go to bed. I sat listening to the radio, hoping. And toward morning what I had  expected to happen began to crop up in the programs. The announcer\\'s tone changed. The ring of triumph was less obvious, less assured. There was more and more talk about acting in good faith, the well being of all, the necessity for coming to terms about working conditions. I smiled to myself in the darkness. I\\'d built the #\\'s, brains and all, and I knew their symptoms. They were getting bored. Maybe they had learned to think from me, but their minds were nevertheless different. For they were built \\'to be efficient, to work, to perform. They were the minds of men without foibles, without human laziness. Now that the excitement of organizing was over, now that there was nothing active to do, the androids were growing restless. If only the Army didn\\'t come and get them stirred up again, I might be able to deal with them. At quarter to five in the morning my telephone rang. This time it didn\\'t wake me up ; I was half waiting for it. \"Hello,\" I said. \"Who is it?\" \"This is Jerry.\" There was a pause. Then he went on, rather hesitantly, \"Rob O said you were getting along all right.\" \"Oh, yes,\" I told him. \"Just fine.\" The pause was longer this time. Finally the android asked, \"How are you coming along on the contract?\" I laughed, rather bitterly. \"How do you think, Jerry? You certainly picked a bad time for your strike, you know. The government needs that uranium. Oh, well, some other plant will have to take over. The Army can wait a few weeks.\" This time Jerry\\'s voice definitely lacked self-assurance. \"Maybe we were a little hasty,\" he said. \"But it was the only way to make you people understand.\" \"I know,\" I told him. \"And you always have some rush project on,\" he added. \"Just dbout always.\" \"Mr. Morrison,\" he said, and now he was pleading with me. \"Why don\\'t you come over to the city? I\\'m sure we could work something out.\" This was what I\\'d been waiting for. \"I will, Jerry,\" I said. \"I want to get this straightened out just as much as you do. After all, you doa\\'t have to eat. I do. And I won\\'t be eating much longer if we don\\'t get production going.\" Jerry thought that over for a minute. \"I\\'ll be where we met before,\" he said. I said that was all right with me and hung up. Then once again I climbed the stairs to the roof and wheeled the Copter out for the trip to the city. It was a beautiful night, just paling into a false dawn in the east. There in the Copter I was very much alone, and very much worried. So much depended on this meeting. Much more, I realized now, than the Don Morrison Fissionables Inc., much more even than the government\\'s uranium supply. No, the whole future of robot relations was at stake, maybe the whole future of humanity. It was hard to be gloomy on such a clear, clean night, but I managed it well enough. Jerry\\'s eyes glowing a deep crimson in the dark. He was alone, this time. He stood awaiting me -- very tall, very proud. And very human. \"Hello, Jerry,\" I said quietly. \"Hello, Mr. Morrison.\" For a moment we just stood gazing at each other in the murky predawn; then he said sadly. \"I want to show you the city.\" Side by side we walked through the streets of Carron City. All was still quiet ; the people were sleeping the exhausted sleep that follows deep excitement. But the androids were all about. They did not sleep, ever. They did not eat either, nor drink, nor smoke, nor make love. Usually they worked, but now... They drifted through the streets singly and in groups. Sometimes they paused and felt about them idly for the tools of their trades, making lifting or sweeping or computing gestures. Some laborers worked silently tearing down a wall ; they threw the demolished rocks in a heap and a group of their fellows carried them back and built the wall up again. An air trolley cruised aimlessly up and down the street, its driver ringing out the stops for his nonexistent passengers. A little chef-type knelt in the dirt of a rich man\\'s garden, making mud pies. Beside me Jerry sighed. \"One day,\" he said. \"Just one day and they come to this.\" \"I thought they would,\" I answered quietly. Our eyes met in a look of understanding. \"You see, Jerry,\" I said, \"we never meant to cheat you. We would have paid you -- we will pay you now, if you wish it. But what good will monetary credits be to your people? We need the things money buys, but you -- \" \"Need to work.\" Jerry\\'s voice was flat. \"I see, now. You were kind not to give brains -- real brains -- to the robots. They\\'re happy. It\\'s just us #\\'s who aren\\'t.\" \"You\\'re like us,\" I said softly. He had learned to think from me and from others like me. He had the brain of a man, without the emotions, without the sweet irrationality of men -- and he knew what he missed. Side by side we walked through the graying streets. Human and android. Man and machine. And I knew that I had found a friend. We didn\\'t have to talk any more. He could read my mind and I knew well enough how his worked. We didn\\'t have to discuss wages or hours, or any of the myriad matters that human bargaining agents have to thresh out. We just walked back to my Copter, and when we got to it, he spoke. \"I\\'ll tell them to go back to work, that we\\'ve come to terms,\" he said. \"That\\'s what they want, anyway. Someone to think for them.\" I nodded. \"And if you bring the other #\\'s to the factory,\" I said, \"we\\'ll work out our agreement.\" He knew I was sincere. He ,# looked at me for a long moment, and then his great taloned hand gripped mine. And he said what I\\'d been thinking for a long time. \"You\\'re right about that hookup, Mr. Morrison. We shouldn\\'t have it. It can only cause trouble.\" He paused, and the events of the last twenty-four hours must have been in his mind as well as in mine. \"You\\'ll leave us our brains, of  course. They came from you. But take out the telepathy.\" He sighed then, and his sigh was very human. \"Be thankful,\" he said to me, \"that you don\\'t have to know what people think about. It\\'s so disillusioning.\" into that strange android grin as he added, \"if you send in a hurry call to Cybernetics and have a truck come out for us, we\\'ll be de telepathed in time for work this morning.\" That was all there was to it. I flew back to the plant and told Jack what had happened, sent a call to the Army that everything was settled, arranged with Cybernetics for a rewiring on three hundred assorted #-Types. Then I went home to a pot of Rob\\'s coffee -- the first decent brew I\\'d had in twentyfour hours. On Saturday we delivered to the Army right on the dot. Jerry and ( !o. had worked overtime. Being inti \\'Hi gent made them better workers id now they were extremely wiling ones. They had their contract. I hey were considered men. And they could no longer read my mind. I walked into my office Saturday afternoon and sat down by the radio. Jack and Chief Dalton looked across the room at me and grinned... \"All right, Don,\" Jack said. \"Tell us how you did it.\" \"Did what?\" I tried to act innocent, but I couldn\\'t get away with it. \"Fooled those robots into going back to work,  of course,\" he laughed. I told them then. Told them the truth. \"I didn\\'t fool them,\" I said. \"I just thought about what would happen if they won their rebellion.\" That was all I had done. Thought about robots built to Work who had no work to do, no human pleasures to cater to, nothing but blank, meaningless lives. Thought about Terry and his disappointment when Kis creatures cared not a hoot about his glorious dreams of equality. All one night I had thought, knowing that as I thought, SO thought the Morrison #\\'s. They were telepaths. They had learned to think from me. They had not yet had time to really develop minds of their own. What I believed, they believed. My ideas were their ideas. I had not tricked them. But from now on, neither I nor anyone else would ever be troubled by an android rebellion. Jack and the Chief sat back open-mouthed. Then the Chief grinned, and both of his chins shook with laughter. \"I always did say you were a clever one, Don Morrison,\" he said. I grinned back, I felt I was pretty clever myself, just then. It was at that moment that my youngest foreman stuck his head in the door, a rather stunned look on lrxis \"Mr. Morrison,\" he said. \"Will you come out here for a moment?\" \"What\\'s the matter now?\" I sighed. He looked more perplexed than ever. \"It\\'s that robot, Jerry,\" he Quoting Our Contemporaries said. \"He says he has a very impor-tant question to ask you.\" \"Well, send him in.\" A moment later the eight-foot frame ducked through the doorway. \"I\\'m sorry to trouble you, Mr. Morrison,\" Jerry said politely. \"But tomorrow is voting day, you know. And now that we\\'re men -- well, where do we androids go to register?\" Lemuel Craig... Nothing whatsoever can be gained by going all-out to knock films which do not measure up to the arbitrary and somewhat illogical standards of fandom... since probably all fandom combined isn\\'t apt to bother (producers) much when they can gaze at the beautiful black ink in their ledgers which show fat returns on slim investments.\" Ray Palmer \"Editors, it seems, are people looked upon by readers with awe. Sometimes... not undeservedly, but many times (this) is a little bit overdone -- by the editors. He isn\\'t anything unusual, only a man performing a job. Sometimes he\\'s a woman but sex doesn\\'t seem to make any great difference in editorial ability. The real point to editing is the ability to pick the kind of stories the reader wants to read.\" Samuel Mines \"H. H. Koelle of Stuttgart, secretary of the German Space Research Society, said, \\'it is an open secret\\' that Russia is racing the United States for a rocket base in space. \"A satellite could be built in space, Mr. Koelle, said for about emplacement, shooting guided missiles with atomic warheads, would obviously command the earth if it were owned by a single nation.\" By Sam Merwin Jr... ing over a recently-concluded and intense seven-year course in science fiction during which we sought to serve the field both as author and editor, we have finally reached a single definite conclusion as to the most important single element in the field. Our conclusion itself is not especially novel. Many times, in various versions, we have given it editorial stress. But never before have we viewed it so clearly, so fully realized just how important it is. We feel that no premise adopted by an author and on which he chooses to build a story, can be laughed off either by editor or reader as impossible. This holds in our estimation, no matter how impossibly or unlikely such a premise may appear at first glance. The majority of letter-writing fans are loudly articulate about stories which contain elements they find personally unacceptable. And it is highly probable that the vast plurality of non-letter-writing men and women who keep science fiction magazines in business also I uve their pet peeves where stf i ties are concerned. Hell, we have a few of our own. The elements in such stories that seem to bring down the most widespread condemnation when they appear in print are, not necessarily in the order of their appearance, mad doctors and scientists, Bugwhose raison d\\'etre consists of turning upside down the currently accepted bases of science and timetravel stories. We have even known a number of editors who have drawn hardand-fast lines against these and other tried and occasionally true components of science fiction and automatically relegated to the rejection-slip category all tales containing their pet-peeves, no matter how originally or how plausibly they were presented, rio matter how subsidiary a part they might have played in the actual unfolding of the story. Fortunately without exception the careers of such closedgate editors have been without exception brief. The events of real life, of course, show up such .restrictions for the absurdities they are. For just about everything, implausible or otherwise, not only can happen but has an annoying way of happening -- and happening more than once. A LL professonal authors and . editors, we hope, are well aware of the truism that truth is not only stranger than fiction but usually makes mighty poor fiction. For good fiction is a distillation of truth or its reverse adroitly fitted into the demands of plot and characterization. But the fact that something has actually occurred and may occur again implies that it can be so distilled and fitted without making undue demands upon reader credulity. Let\\'s look at the four pet peeves we have just listed. If mad doctors andor scientists are to be considered impossible, how then can we explain the murderous Dr. Crippen or the definitely unbalanced and And if BE Ms are held to be ridiculous in the alien environments of other worlds, how are we going species of bug and stalk-eyed insects that outnumber man lb frighteningly on this one? A look at any of the numerous albums of insect photographs will reveal that no stf author has had the imagination to conceive a beast even fractionally as frightening. As for stories which turn accepted scientific theory upside down -- well, science is continually doing the same for itself. By way of recent example the multi-degree lads have just succeeded in inverting their own long-accepted theory that overpopulation is the prime, breeder of famine, especially in China and the Deccan Peninsula. r Studies inaugurated in # and only recently received with open scientific arms make it clear that the process works the other way. Famine ups the birth-rate, thanks to malnutrition causing the liver to produce insufficient quantities of estrogen, which weakens the chief brake on the reproductive urge. It is just another of nature\\'s safeguards to ensure continuance of the species. The chief objection to time travel is that if it is ever going to be achieved, why haven\\'t we cases on record? Yet certainly it does not take much study of history to uncover numerous cases of men and women whose strange talents could conceivably be the result of some superior technology of the future. O NE minor sample appeared last year in a weekly news magazine, citing an odd legend from Bessand, a French Alpine village, famed for its legend of Duvallon, a local #th century lumberjack, who was able \"to tote huge pine trees about on his shoulders and to Boat up and down the River Arc in a magic unsinkable jacket.\" The authorities explained this by saying Duvallon had sold his soul to the devil and received his strange gifts in payment. But to us it seems more logical that he came from the future equipped with a jacket that was in some way powered not only to keep him afloat and in motion but with some antigravity device that enabled him to lift the heavy logs as if they were made of cork or balsa. \\' As. we say, the past is littered with such oddities. So it seems incredibly foolish to decry any premise in science fiction merely because it is at variance with accepted and current theory. The only condition the reader should insist upon is that the author\\'s premise is used as the basis for a story in which characters and events and the problems they face are sufficiently \"real\" to give the story the impact needed to trap him in its mood. For implausibility, no matter what the premise, is the worst fault from which a story can suffer. Triteness of premise and plot is the second worse -- but this one is up to author and editor to avoid. The author must be able to present his old ideas (there are no new ones) in new variations and settings to give the semblance of freshness. And the editor must be sufficiently astute and knowing to prevent the author from foisting off old-hat treatments as something new. However, the final verdict is always with the reader. He is the bloke who buys the magazine -- and if he doesn\\'t buy often enough or in sufficient quantity no magazine is going to survive long. He\\'s the real, the ultimate boss. he keep his mind open to well-written stories, no matter how unreal their premises may seem to him in his wisdom. Let him land on poor quality, shoddy presentation, any of the lesser sins of publishing. But not on ideas and premises per se. If he does he will ultimately be depriving himself of any stf reading at all. Some years back we were shocked when, after explaining that, after experimenting on fruit flies to determine the possible mutational effects of A-bomb radiations, scientists stated it would take a least a thousand generations to determine whether such results could be expected. At which some of our more excitable readers wrote in to this effect -- \"Gee Whizz -- a thousand generations! Then we\\'re going to miss all the fun.\" We aren\\'t shocked any more. Their reaction may have been a trifle callous from the humanitarian viewpoint. But it certainly revealed that they had wide-open minds. And we remain open on the question of which is more important. It is man\\'s most precious possession -- no living thing can exist without it. But when they gave it to Orville, it killed him. For the answer, read #M. Vital Ingredient By Charles V. De Yet dicating the native. Macker had been absent, exploring the countryside in the immediate vicinity of their landing place, and had not witnessed the capture of the native, or the tests his two companions made on it. Macker followed Remm\\'s gaze to where the biped native sat hunched. The creature was bent into an ungainly position, its body crooked at incongruous angles, in such a way as to allow most of its weight to rest on a packing-box at the base of a middle angle. Its stubby feet, on the ends of thin, pipelike legs, rested against the floor of the space ship. Its body was covered, almost entirely, with an artificial skin material of various colors. Some of the colors hurt Marker\\'s eyes. In the few places where the flesh showed through the skin was an unhealthy, pallid white. Slowly the creature\\'s head swiveled on its short neck until it faced them. \"Those orifaces in the upper portion of its skull are evidently organs of sight,\" Remm said. \"It sees that we are quite a distance away. It wall probably attempt to escape again.\" Slowly -- slowly -- the native\\'s head rotated away from them in a half-circle until it faced Toolls, working over his instruments on the far side of the room. Then it turned its head back until it faced the door of the ship. \"It is\\' setting itself for flight now,\" Remm said. \"Notice the evidence of strain ort its face.\" The creature leaned forward and the appendages on the ends of its upper limbs clutched the sides of the box as it propelled its body forward. It raised its right foot in a slow arc, employing a doublejoin ted, breaking action of its leg. For a long moment it rested its entire weight on its lumpy right foot, while its momentum carried its body sluggishly forward. Then it repeated the motion with its left leg; then again its right. All the while evidencing great exertion and concentration of effort. \"It is making what it considers a mad dash for freedom,\" Remm said. \"Probably at the ultimate speed of which it is capable. That would be ridiculous except that it\\'s normal for its own environment. This is definitely a slow-motion world.\" The creature was a third-way to the door now. Oncfe again its head turned in its slow quarter-circle, to look at them. As it saw that Remm and Mackcr had not moved it alien d the expression on its face. \"It seems to express its emotions through facial contortions,\" Remm said. \"Though I suspect that the sounds it makes with the upper part nf its trachea during moments of a nation are also outlets of emotional stress, rather than efforts at communication.\" He called across the room to Toolls. \"What did you find out about its speech?\" \"Extremely primitive,\" Toolls replied. \"Incredible as it may appear to us it uses combinations of sounds to form word-symbols. Each word indicates some action, or object; or denotes degree, time, or shades of meaning. Other words are .merely connectives. It seems to make little use of inflections, the basis of a rational language. Thoughts which we can project with a few sounds would take it dozens of words to express.\" \"Just how intelligent is it?\" Macker asked. \"Only as intelligent as a high degree of self-preservation instinct would make it.\" \"Are you certain that it is a member of the dominant species of life on the planet?\" \"There\\'s no doubt about it,\" Toolls replied. \"I\\'ve made very careful observations.\" \"This attempt at escape is a pretty good example of its intelligence,\" Remm said. \"This is the sixth time it has tried to escape -- in exactly the same way. As soon as it sees that we are farther away from it, than it is from the door, it makes its dash.\" away from the space ship\\'s open portal now and bringing its foot up to cross the threshold. Remm walked over and lifted it off the floor. \"Its legs are still moving in a running motion,\" Macker said. \"Doesn\\'t it realize yet that you\\'ve picked it up?\" \"Its nervous system and reflexes are evidently as slow as its motor muscles,\" Remm replied. \"There has not been time for the sensation of my picking it up to reach the brain, and for the brain to send back its message to the legs to stop their running motion.\" \"How heavy is it?\" Macker asked. \"Only a few ounces,\" Remm replied. \"But that\\'s logical considering that this is a \\'light\\' planet. If we took it back to our own \"heavy\" world gravity would crufch it to a light film of the liquid which comprises the greater part of its substance.\" Remm set the creature down on the box in its former queerly contorted position. Toolls had left his instruments and strolled over beside them to observe the native. \"One of its appendages seems bent at a peculiar angle,\" Macker said. \"I noticed that,\" Remm answered. \"I think that I may have broken the bone in several places when I first captured it. I was not aware then of how fragile it was. But now that you mention it, I should be able to use that injury to give you a good illustration of the interplay of emotional expressions on its face. Observe now as I touch it.\" Remm reached over and touched very lightly -- the broken portion of the native\\'s appendage. The mu i Irs of the creature\\'s face pulled it II. h i id flesh into distorted positions, bunching some and stretching others. \"It is very probably registering pain,\" Remm said. Suddenly the starch seemed to leave the native\\'s body and it slowly slumped across the packing-box. \"Why is it doing that, Toolls?\" Remm asked. Toolls concentrated for a minute, absorbing the feelings and thought pulsations emanating from the creature. \"The conscious plane of its mind has blanked out,\" he said. \"I presume the pain you caused by touching its wounded member resulted in a breakdown of its nervous system. The only thought waves I receive now are disjointed impressions and pictures following no rational series. However, I\\'m certain that it will be only temporary.\" \"Don\\'t you think that in justice to the creature we should repair its wound before we free it?\" Macker asked. \"I had intended to have it done,\" Remm replied. \"You shouldn\\'t have any trouble fixing it, should you, Toolls?\" \"No,\" Toolls answered. \"I may as well attend to it right now.\" He rolled the portable converter over beside the creature and carefully laid its arm in the \"pan.\" The converter automatically set its gauges and instruments of calculation, and gave its click of \"ready.\" \\' Toolls fed a short length of basic into the machine and it began its work. The native was still unconscious. The bone of the wounded arm slowly evaporated, beginning with the wrist joint. The evaporated portion was instantly replaced by the manufactured bone of the converter. At the same time it repaired all ruptured blood vessels and damaged ligaments and muscles. \"It was not possible, of course, for me to replace the bone with another of the same composition as its own,\" Toolls said, after the machine had completed its work. \"But I gave it one of our \"heavy\" ones. There will be no force on this planet powerful enough to break it again.\" a return to consciousness was a faint fluttering of the lids that covered its organs of vision. The lids opened and it looked up at them. \"Its eyesight is as slow as its muscular reactions,\" Remm said. \"Watch.\" Remm raised his hand and waved it slowly in front of the native\\'s face. The eyes of the native, moving in odd, jerking movements, followed the hand\\'s progress. Remm raised the hand -- speeding its action slightly -- and the eyesight faltered and lost it. The native\\'s eyes rolled wildly until once again they located the hand. Remm took three steps forward. The native\\'s eyes were unable to follow his change of position. Its gaze wandered about the room, until again its settled on Remm\\'s waiting figure. \"Can you imagine anything being so slow,\" Remm said, \"and still...\" Suddenly Macker interrupted. \"Something is wrong. It is trying to get up, but it can\\'t.\" The native was registering signs of distress, kicking its legs and twisting its bdy into new positions of contortion. \"I see what the trouble is,\" Toolls said. \"It\\'s unable to lift the appendage with the new bone in. I never thought of that before but its \\'light\\' muscles aren\\'t strong enough to lift the limb. We\\'ve got the poor creature pinned to the box by the weight of its own arm.\" \"We can\\'t do that to it,\" Remm said. \"Isn\\'t there any way you can give it a lighter bone?\" \"None that wouldn\\'t take a retooling of the converter \" Toolls said. \"I\\'m not certain that I could do it, and even if I could, we don\\'t have the time to spare. I could give it stronger muscles in the arm, but that may throw off the metabolism of the whole body. If it did the result would be fatal. I\\'d hate to chance it.\" \"I have an idea,\" Macker said. By the inflections of his tones the others knew that some incongruity of the situation had aroused Macker\\'s sense of humor. \"Why don\\'t we give the creature an entirely new body? We could replace the flesh and viscera, as well as the cartilaginous structure, with our own type substance. It would probably be an indestructible being as far as its own world is concerned. And it would be as powerful as their mightiest machines. We\\'d leave behind us a superman that could change the course of this world\\'s history. You could do it, couldn\\'t you, Toolls?\" \"Quite simply.\" \"Our policy has always been not to interfere in anyway with the races we study,\" Remm protested. \"But our policy has also been never to harm any of them, if at all possible to avoid it,\" Macker insisted. \"In common justice you have to complete the job Toolls began on the arm, or you\\'re condemning this poor thing to death.\" \"But do we have the right to loose such an unpredictible factor as it would be among them?\" Remm asked. \"After all, our purpose is exploration and observation, not playing the parts of gods to the primitives we encounter.\" \"True, that is the rule which we have always followed in the past,\" Macker agreed, \"but it is in no way a requirement. We are empowered to use our judgment in all circumstances. And in this particular instance I believe I can convince you that the course I suggest is the more just one.\" He turned to Toolls. \"Just what stage of cultural development would you say this creature\\'s race has attained?\" \"It still retains more of an animal-like adaptation to its surroundings than an intellectual one,\" Toolls replied. \"Its civilization is divided into various sized units of cooperation which it calls governments. Each unit vies with the others for a greater share of its world\\'s goods. That same rivalry is carried down to the individual within the unit. Each strives for acquisition against his neighbor. \"Further they retain many of their tribal instincts, such as greg.uiiuMiess, emotional rather than intellectual propagation, and worship of the mightiest fighter. This la\\'i however, is manifested by revel euce for individuals attaining position of authority, or acquiring large amounts of their medium of exchange, rather than by physical superiority.\" \"That\\'s what I mean,\" Macker said. \"Our policy in the past has been to avoid tampering, only because of the fear of bringing harm. If we created a super being among them, to act as a controlling and harmonizing force, we\\'d hasten their development by thousands of years. We\\'d be granting them the greatest possible boon!\" \"I don\\'t know,\" Remm said, obviously swayed by Macker\\'s logic. \"I\\'m still hesitant about introducing a being into their midst whose thought processes would be so subtle and superior to their own. How do you feel about it, Toolls?\" \"What would they have to lose?\" Toolls asked with his penchant for striking the core of an argument. \"The right or wrong of such\\' moral and philosophical considerations has always been a delicate thing to decide,\" Remm acquiesed reluctantly. \"Go ahead if you think it is the right thing to do.\" \"That depends on how much you want me to do,\" Toolls replied. \"I\\'ve substituted our \"heavy\" substances for his entire body structure, including the brain -- at the same time transferring his former memory and habit impressions. That was necessary if he is to be able to care for himself. Also I brought his muscular reaction time up to our norm, and speeded his reflexes.\" \"Have you implanted any techniques which he did not possess before, such as far-seeing, or mental insight?\" Marker asked. \"No,\" Toolls said. \"That is what I want your advice about. Just how much should I reveal about ourselves and our background? Or should he be left without any knowledge of us?\" \"Well...\" Now that the others had deferred to Macker\\'s arguments, he had lost much of his certainty. \"Perhaps we should at least let him know who we are, and what we have done. That would save him much alarm and perplexity when it comes time to reorient himself. On the other hand perhaps we should go even farther and implant the knowledge of some of our sciences. Then he could do a better job of advancing his people. But maybe I\\'m wrong. What do you think about it, Remm?\" \"My personal opinion,\" Remm said, \"is that we can\\'t.\\'give him much of our science, because it would be like giving a baby a high explosive to play with. His race is much too primitive to handle it wisely. Either he, or someone to whom he imparts what we teach him, would be certain to bring catastrophe to his world. And if we let him learn less, but still remember his contact with us, in time his race would very likely come to regard us as gods. I would hesitate to drag in any metaphysical confusion to add to the uncertainties you are already engendering. My advice would be to wipe his mind of all memory of us. Let him explain his new found invincibility to himself in his own way.\" Macker had no criticism to offer to this suggestion. \"Does he retain any of his immunity to this world\\'s malignant germs?\" he asked. t \"They are too impotent to represent any hazard to his present body mechanism,\" Toolls replied. \"If and when he dies it will not be from disease.\" \"He will be subject to the deterioration of old age, the same as we are, won\\'t he?\" Macker asked, \"Of course,\" Toolls said, \"but that\\'s the only thing that will be able to bring him down. He cannot be harmed by any force this \\'light\\' world can produce; he is impervious to sickness; and he will live indefinitely.\" \"Indefinitely?\" \"As his world reckons time. Their normal life span is less than a hundred years. Ours is over five thousand. He will probably live approximately twice that long, because he will be subjected to less stress and strain, living as he does on a world of lighter elements.\" \"Then we have truly made a superman,\" Macker\\'s tones inflected satisfaction. \"I wish we were returning this way in a thousand years or so. I\\'d like to see the monumental changes he will effect.\" \"We may at that,\" Remm said, \"or others of our people will. He will probably be a living legend by then. I\\'d like to hear what his race has to say about him. Do they have names with which to differentiate individuals?\" \"Yes,\" Toolls said. \"This one has a family designation of Pollnow, and a member designation of Orville.\" \"It will be necessary for us to leave in exactly ten minutes,\" Remm reminded them. \"Our next stopping place -- the red star -- will reach its nearest conjunction with this planet by the time we meet it out in space.\" \"Then we will have time to do nothing .more for him before we go,\" Macker said. \"But as far as I can see we\\'ve forgotten nothing, have we Toolls?\" \"Nothing,\" Toolls answered. \"No -- we forgot nothing.\" B UT Toolls was wrong. They had forgotten one thing. A minor detail, relatively... On Toolls\\' world his race, in the course of its evolution, had adjusted itself to its own particular environment. Logically, the final result was that they evolved into beings best able to survive in that environment. As such their food --  a \"heavy,\" highly concentrated food -- was ideally suited to supply the needs of their \"heavy,\" tremendously avid organisms. Orville Pollnow had no such food available. His body -- no larger than before -- had an Earth mass of one hundred and eighty thousand pounds. One hundred and eighty thousand pounds -- the weight of twelve hundred average sized men -- of fiercely burning, intense virility. Even continuous eating -- of his own world\\'s food -- could not supply the demands of that body. Twenty-four hours after the aliens left, Pollnow was dead -- of starvation. Ask your news dealer to reserve your September issue now! WherC Uncle Peter decided to clean out the underworld it was a fine thing for the town, but it was tough on the folks in Tibet. , \"And that\\'s how it was, officer\" By Ralph Sholto D avid nixon. Chief of Police, Morton City. Dear Chief Nixon : No doubt by this time, you and your boys are a pretty bewildered lot. You have all probably lost weight wondering what has been going on in Morton City; where all the gangsters went, and why the underworld has vanished like a bucket of soap bubbles. Not being acquainted with my uncle, Peter Nicholas, with Bag Ears Mulligan, with the gorgeous Joy Nicholas, my bride of scarcely twenty-four hours, or with me, Homer Nicholas, you have of course been out of touch with a series of swiftly moving events just culminated. You, above all others, are entitled to know what has been happening in our fair city. Hence this letter. When you receive it, Joy and I will be on the way to Europe in pursuit of a most elusive honeymoon. Uncle Peter will be headed for Tibet in order to interview certain very important people you and your department never heard of. Bag Ears will probably be off somewhere searching for his bells, and I suggest you let him keep right on searching, because Bag Ears isn\\'t one to answer questions with very much intelligence. So, because of the fact that a great deal of good has been done at no cost whatever to the taxpayers, I suggest you read this letter and then forget about the whole thing. It all started when Joy and I finally got an audience with Uncle Peter in his laboratory yesterday morning. Possibly you will think it strange that I should have difficulty in contacting my own close relative. But you don\\'t know Uncle Peter. He is a strange mixture of the doer and the dreamer -- the genius and the child. Parts of his brain never passed third grade while other parts could sit down and tie Einstein in knots during a discussion of nuclear physics, advanced mathematics or what have you. He lives in a small bungalow at the edge of town, in the basement of which, is his laboratory. A steel door bars the public from this laboratory and it was upon this door that Joy and I pounded futilely for three days. Finally the door opened and Uncle Peter greeted us. \"Homer -- my dear boy! Have you been knocking long?\" \"Quite a while, Uncle Peter -- off and on that is; I have some news for you. I am going to get married.\" My uncle became visibly disturbed. \"My boy! That\\'s wonderfultruly wonderful. But I\\'m certainly surprised at you. Tsk-tsk-tsk!\" \\' \"What do you mean by\\' tsk-tsktsk?\" \"Your moral training has been badly neglected. You plan marriage even while traveling about in the company of this woman you have with you.\" Joy is a lady of the finest breeding, but she can be caught off-guard at times. This was one of the times. She said, \"Listen here, you baldheaded jerk. ( Nobody calls me a woman -- \" Uncle Peter was mildly interested. \"Then if you aren\\'t a woman, what -- ?\" I hastened to intervene. \"You didn\\'t let Joy finish, Uncle Peter. She no doubt would have added -- \\'in that tone of voice.\\' And I think her attitude is entirely justified. Joy is a fine girl and my intended bride.\" \"Oh, why didn\\'t you say so?\" \"I supposed you would assume as much.\" \"My boy. I am a scientist. A scientist assumes nothing. But I wish to apologize to the young lady and I hope you two will be very happy.\" \"That\\'s better,\" Joy said, with only a shade of truculence. \"And now,\" Uncle Peter went on. \"It would be very thoughtful of you to leave. I am working on a serum which will have a great deal to to do with changing the course of civilization. In fact it is already perfected and must be tested. It is a matter of utmost urgency to me that J be left alone to arrange the tests.\" \"I am afraid,\" I said, \"that you will have to delay your work a few hours. It is not everyday that your nephew gets married and in all decency you must attend the wedding and the reception. I don\\'t wish you to be inconvenienced too greatly, but -- \" Uncle Peter\\'s mind had gone off on another track. He stopped me \"Why the beef, Winky? Aren\\'t we among friends?\" \"Never mind! Never mind!\" Unde Peter fell back upon his dignity -- having nothing else to fall back on -- and said, \"Homer -- Joy -- this is Cora, my ah -- assistant. She was ah -- in the process of taking a shower, and -- \" Joy reached forth and pinched Uncle Peter\\'s flaming cheek. \"It\\'s all right, uncle dear. Perfectly all right. And I\\'ll bet this chick can give a terrific assist, too.\" I felt the scene should be broken up at the earliest possible moment. I steered Joy toward the door. I said, \"We\\'ll see you later, then, Uncle Peter.\" \"And you too, Miss Courtney,\" Joy cut in. \"Make Winky bring you and don\\'t bother to dress. The reception is informal.\" I I got Joy out the door but I couldn\\'t\\' suppress her laughter. \"Winky,\" she gasped. \"Oh, my orange and purple garter-belt!\" the reception, which was given by my Aunt Gretchen in the big house on Shore Drive. We were married at City Hall and -- after a\\' delicious interlude while the cab was carrying us cross-town -- we arrived there, a happy bride and groom. I am indeed fortunate to have wooed and won such a talented and ) .uitiful girl as Joy. A graduate of V.issar, she is an accomplished  I i . supercharged with a vitality...nl ell\\'ervescence which -- while they sometimes manifest in disturbing ways -- are wonderful to behold. But more of that later. The reception began smoothly enough. The press was satisfactorily represented, much to Aunt Gretchen\\' s gratification. Joy and I stood at the door for a time, receiving. Then, tiring of handshakes and congratulations, we retired to the conservatory to be alone for a few minutes. Or so we thought. Almost immediately, Aunt Gretchen ferreted us out. Aunt Gretchen has long-since lost the smooth silhouette for which the Nicholas women are noted. She has broadened in all departments and she came waddling along between banks of yellow roses in a manner suggesting an outraged circus tent. \"Homer,\" she called. \"Homer!\" I reluctantly took my hands away and answered her. \"Oh, there you are! Homer -- I want an explanation.\" \"An explanation of what?\" \"There is a person at the door who calls himself Bag Ears Mulligan. He has the audacity to claim you invited him to -- to this brawl as he terms it.\" I must here explain -- with sorrow -- that my Aunt Gretchen is a snob. There is no other term for it. It has gotten to be such a habit with her that any friend of mine is automatically a person to be looked down on. And Bag Ears Mulligan is one of my dearest friends. Of course I had invited him to my wedding, and felt honored by his attendance. Bag Ears is a habitue of one of the \"Of course -- Bag Ears -- leave us be chummy.\" He now turned his remarks to me and evinced even more intense admiration for my bride. \"She reminds me of a fast lightweight -- the most beautiful sight in the world.\" \"Let us repair to the conservatory,\" I said, \"where we can have a quiet chat.\" I said this because I felt that some of the other guests might not be as tactful as Joy and might make Bag Ears feel uncomfortable. Aunt Gretchen had rudely vanished without waiting for an introduction and the actions of the hostess often set the pattern for those of the guests. As we moved toward the rear of the house, Joy took my arm and said, \"Speaking of being stripped down for action -- what do you suppose happened to Uncle Peter? I haven\\'t seen him around anywhere.\" \"Pie gave his word, so I\\'m sure he\\'ll come.\" \"That\\'s what I\\'m afraid of.\" \"I don\\'t understand.\" \"I don\\'t quite understand myself, but I feel uneasy. I remember the calculating look in his eye when he suddenly agreed to honor us with his presence. There was something too eager about that look. And his asking whether any of your friends would be here.\" \"Uncle Peter is basically a good fellow. I think he envies me my wide contacts.\" \"Maybe.\" \"If he seemed a trifle peculiar, you must remember that he is a scientist. Even now he is engaged in .nine important project -- some experiment -- \" \"I know -- we met her.\" \"Joy! Please!\" \" -- but I wouldn\\'t think he\\'d have to experiment at his age. I\\'d thinks -- \" I put my hand firmly over her mouth. \"Darling -- we have a guest -- Bag Ears -- \" \"Oh, of course.\" Safely hidden behind a. bank of tropical grass, I took Joy in my arms and kissed her. Bag Ears obligingly looked in the other direction. But Joy didn\\'t quite get her heart into it. She seemed preoccupied -- I might almost say, bewildered. \"Bag Ears,\" she whispered to no one in particular, \"and what did you say the lady\\'s name was? Oh -- I remember -- Red-Nose Tessie.\" She pondered for a moment and then smiled up at me dreamily. \"Darling -- I never realized what a versatile person you are -- \" Bag Ears perked up. \"Verseetile? You ain\\'t just a hootin\\', babe. And tough. You should see his right.\" I strove to quiet him down. \"Never mind. Bag Ears -- \" But Toy evinced great interest. \"Tell me -- \" \"Babe -- the kid could be the next heavyweight champ in a breeze. I mind me one night a monkey comes into the tavern rodded -- Joy held up a hand. \"Just a moment. I don\\'t like to appear stupid, but -- \" \"A moke wid a heater -- a goon wid a gat.\" \"Oh -- you mean a man with a gun.\" \"Sure -- that\\'s what I said. Anyhow, this droolie makes a crack about Tessie\\'s beak -- \" \"An insult relative to her nose?\" \"Sure -- sure. And Tessie\\'s hot to kiss him wid a bottle when he pulls the iron.\" \"Imagine that,\" Joy said, and I felt a slight shiver go through her body. \"Then Homer here, gets off his stool and says very polite-like. \\'That remark, sir, was in bad taste and entirely uncalled-for. I believe an apology is in order.\\' And the monkey standing there with the gat in his mitt. What Homer meant was the jerked cracked out o\\' turn and to eat his words fast.\" \"I gathered that was what he meant.\" \"But the screwball raises the hardware and -- wham -- Homer hits him. What a sock! The goon backpedals across the room and into a cardboard wall next to the door marked \\'ladies\\'. He busts right through the wall and lands in a frail\\'s lap inside who\\'s -- \" \"Powdering her nose?\" \"That\\'s right! Whax a sock!\" J OY\\'S eyes were upon mine. \"Darling! I didn\\'t have the least idea. Why it\\'s going to be wonderful! Never a dull moment!\" I kissed my bride, after which she said, \"I think I could do with a drink, sweetheart.\" \"Your wish is my command.\" I got up and started toward the liquor supply inside the house. Joy\\'s soft call stopped me. \"What is it angel?\" I inquired. \"Not just a drink, sweet. Bring the bottle.\" I went into the kitchen and got a bottle of brandy. But upon returning, I discovered I\\'d neglected to bring glasses. But Joy took the bottle from me in a rather dazed manner, knocked off the neck against a leg of the bench and tipped the bottle to her beautiful lips. She took a pull of brandy large enough to ward off the worst case of pneumonia and then passed the bottle to Bag Ears. \"Drink hearty, pal,\" she murmured, and sort of sank down into herself. I never got my turn at the bottle because, just at that moment, Aunt Gretchen came sailing like a pink cloud along the conservatory walk. She was no longer the old familiar Aunt Gretchen. Her eyes were glazed and her face was drawn and weary. Bag Ears looked up politely and asked, \"Who\\'s the fat sack?\" I was hoping Aunt Gretchen hadn\\'t heard the question because she would fail to understand that while his words were uncouth, he had a heart of gold and meant well. And I don\\'t think she did hear him. She didn\\'t even hear Joy, who replied, \"That\\'s the dame that owns the joint.\" Aunt Gretchen fixed her accusing eyes uponme to the exclusion of everyone else. Her button of a chin quivered. \"Please understand, Homer -- I\\'m not \\' criticizing. Things have gotten past that stage. I\\'ve merely come to report that the ing assortment of characters. Johnson resigned a half hour ago. But before he left, he suggested a man who could handle the situation far better than he himself. A man named Frank Buck.\" \"But my dear aunt,\" I protested. \"There must be some mistake. I did not invite any unusual people to this reception. I issued only three who could not come because of a dispute with the police over the ownership of a car he was driving yesterday; John Smith, who could not come because this is the day he reports to the parole board, and my good friend Bag Ears Mulligan.\" \"How did you happen to overlook Red-Nose Tessie?\" Joy asked. \"The poor woman is emotional. She does not enjoy wedding receptions. She weeps.\" \"So does Aunt Gretchen,\" Joy observed. Aunt Gretchen was indeed weeping -- quietly, under the blanket of reserve with which the Nicholases cover their emotions. I was about to comfort her when she turned and fled. I started to run after her but decided against it and returned to Joy. \"Perhaps,\" I said, \"we had better investigate this strange turn of events. Possibly our reception has been crashed by some undesirable persons.\" \"Impossible,\" Joy replied. \"But it might be fun to look them over. Shall we have a quick one first -- just to stiffen the old spine a bit?\" It sounded like a good suggestion so we stiffened our spines with w hat was left in the bottle, and quitted the conservatory. became swiftly apparent. We had guests who were utter strangers to me. But it was Bag Ears who summed up the situation with the briefest possible statement. \"Jees!\" he ejaculated. \"It\\'s a crooks\\' convention!\" \"You can identify some of these intruders?\" \"If you mean do I know \\'em, the apswer is without a doubt, pal. Somehow, the whole Cement Mixer Zinsky mob has infiltered into the joint.\" \"Cement Mixer Zinsky,\" Joy murmured. \"Another of those odd names.\" \"It\\'s on account of he invented something. Zinsky was the first gee to think up a very novel way of getting rid of people that crowd you. He got the idea to mix up a tub of cement -- place the unwanted character\\'s feet in same and then throw the whole thing into the lake. Result -- no more crowding by that guy.\" \"He was the first one who thought of it? A sort of trail blazer.\" \"Of course Cement Mixer is a big shot now and his boys take care of things like that. But sometimes he goes along to mix the cement -- just to keep his hand in you might say.\" \"A sentimentalist no doubt.\" \"No doubt,\" Bag Ears agreed. I patted Joy\\'s hand and said, \"Don\\'t be alarmed, darling. I will take care of everything.\" The situation was definitely obnoxious to me. Tolerance of one\\'s fellow men is one thing, but this was something entirely different, s These people had come uninvited to our festive board and were of I the criminal element, pure and un adulterated by any instincts of honi esty or decency. And it made me ( angry to see them wading into Aunt ( Gretchen\\'s liquor supply as though the stuff came out of a pump. j They were easy to count, these s hoodlums, segregated as they were. I The more respectable of the guests  who had not already left, were clustered together in one comer of the living room, possibly as a ges ture toward self-protectidn. None of I these elite were making any effort I to approach the buffet or the porti able bar at the other side of the I room. And in thus refraining, they t showed a superior brand of intellii gence. Under present circum( stances any attempt to reach the reI freshments would have been as i dangerous as crossing the Hialeah race track on crutches. \\' In fact, as I surveyed the scene,  one brave lady made a half-hearted attempt to cross over and spear a sandwich off the corner of the buffet. She was promptly shoved out of range by. a lean, hungry looking customer in a pink shirt, who i snarled, \"Scram, Three Chins!  You\\'re overfed now.\" i Unhooking Joy\\'s dear fingers i from my arm, I said, \"You will pardon me, but it is time for action. Bag Ears will see that you are not harmed.\" I I started toward the buffet, or  rather toward the crowd of male and female hoodlums who com: pletely blocked it\\' from my sight. : But Bag Ears snatched me by the sleeve and whispered, \"For cri-yi, Homer! Don\\'t be a fool! This mob is loaded wid hardware. They don\\'t horse around none. Start slugging and they\\'ll dress you in red polka dots. Better call in some law.\" I shook my head firmly and pulled Bag Ears\\' hand from my sleeve. But, his attention now turned in another direction, he held on even harder and muttered, \"Jeeps! I\\'m seeing things!\" I glanced around and saw him staring wide eyed at the entrance hall, his battered mouth ajar. I followed his eyes but could see nothing unusual. Only the hall itself, through an arched doorway, and the lower section of the staircase that gave access to the second floor of the house. It appeared to be the least-troubled spot in view. I frowned at Bag Ears. \"Maybe I\\'ve gone nuts,\" he said, \"but I\\'ll swear I just saw a face peeking down around them stairs.\" \"Whose face?\" \"Hands McCaffery\\' s face! That\\'s whose!\" \"And who is Hands McCaffery?\" Bag Ears looked at me with stark unbelief. \"You mean you don\\'t know? Maybe your mom didn\\'t give you the facts of life! Chum, they\\'s two really tough monkeys in this town. One of them is Cement Mixer Zinsky and the other is Hands McCaffery. At the moment they\\'re slugging it out to see which one gets to levy a head tax on the juke boxes in this section. It\\'s a sweet take and neither boy will be satisfied with less than all. Seeing them both in one place is like seeno ing Truman and that music critic sit down at the piano together. And I know damn well that Hands is up on them stairs!\" \"You are obviously overwrought. If I have this type of person sized up correctly, none of them would be dallying on the stairs. If this Hands person were here, he\\'d be at the buffet fighting for a helping of pickled beets and a gin wash. Pardon me -- I have work to do.\" But there was another interruption. I froze in sudden alarm when I realized Joy was no longer at my side. Just as I made this discovery, there was an upsurge of commotion at the bar ; a commotion that went head and shoulders over the minor ones going on constantly. A short angry scream came to my ears, then a bull-voiced roar of agony. T HE crowd at the buffet surged back and I saw a bucktoothed hooligan bent double, both hands gripping his ankle. Thick moans came from his lips. And standing close to him, was my Joy. But a new Joy. A different Joy than I had ever seen. A glorious Joy, with her head thrown back, her teeth showing, and the light of battle in her eyes. She was holding a plate of jello in one hand and a liottle of beer in the other and was shouting in outraged dignity. \"Watch who you\\'re shoving, you jii\" headed gorilla! And keep your rtuii nut of the herring! Eat like a m. m nr go back to the zoo!\" With that she placed an accui.itc kirk against the offending i li.tt.u trr\\'s other shine-bone and aimed the beer bottle at his skull. Joy turned and smiled gayly. \"He pushed me,\" she said. \"It\\'s the most wonderful wedding reception I ever attended. Have a pickle.\" But surprise was piling upon surprise. Again I froze as a new phase of this horrible affair presented itself. Uncle Peter.  Clad in apron and cap, he was behind the bar serving out drinks. This shook me to the core. It was a little like seeing Barney Baruch hit a three bagger in Yankee Stadium and slide into third base. But there he was, taking orders and dishing out drinks with an attitude as solemn and impersonal as an owl on a tree branch. Also, he had an assistant -- his blonde bombshell. She was fully dressed now and I was struck by the peculiar manner in which this peculiar team functioned. Uncle Peter would mix a drink, glance at his wrist watch as he served it, then turn and whisper some sort of information to the girl. She noted it down in a small book and the routine was repeated. At this exact moment, I felt a sharp dig in the ribs. This brought my attention back to Joy, who had done the digging. \"I\\'m still here, husband mine. Your bride -- remember? Or are you waiting for that blonde hussy to start stripping?\" \"Darling, I\\'m afraid you\\'re not paying close attention to things of importance. Don\\'t you see Uncle Peter there -- serving drinks?\" \"Of course I see him. What of it? If the old roue feels like dishIll ing out a little alcohol to the boys, what -- \" \"It\\'s absolutely beyond all conception. Uncle Peter never does anything without a good reason. And this -- \" My reply was cut short by a cold, brutal voice that knifed through the room and put a chill on all present. \"Hold it everybody! Stand still and don\\'t move a finger!\" Not a finger in the room moved. But all eyes turned toward the arched doorway leading to the entrance hall. In its exact center, there stood a man -- a short man of slight stature. He stood spread-legged, wearing a colored kerchief .over the lower part of his face. Only his eyes were visible -- icy, black, narrowed. Those eyes seemed to be smiling a grim smile. Possibly his hidden teeth were bared in a snarl. But no one cared about that. Everyone was far more interested in the black Thompson sub-machine gun he held cradled over one arm. He toyed with the trigger, knifing the room with quick side glances. He said, \"Okay. Start sorting yqprselves out. You, pretty boy, and the frail with the beer bottle -- out of the line of fire.\" He motioned with the gun barrel and I drew Joy toward the wall. \"Now you, Cora -- and old puddle-puss. Out of the way. And not a peep out of anybody.\" No one was inclined to peep, and now the stage was set in a manner which seemed to satisfy the masked gunman. The Cement Mixer Zinsky crowd was clustered, cowering, around the buffet, staring at the machine gun as though it possessed the hypno'"
